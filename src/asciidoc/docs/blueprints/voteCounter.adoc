= Vote Counter Template
:page-slug: vote-counter-blueprint

Follow this blueprint to build a template that counts votes from multiple users in real-time.
You will implement a database to record the users and votes and real-time dispatch to provide users with an immediate, multi-user experience.
Then, you will publish the template on Koji.

== Building blocks

=== Remix the scaffold

Remix an existing web application on Koji that implements basic elements of your favorite framework.

=== Add the backend service

This template relies on a backend service to store the total number of votes from different users and sessions.

Create a `backend` directory in the root of the project, and then create `backend/package.json` to define the dependencies for your backend service.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-package.json[]
----

Install the dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
cd backend
npm install
----

Create `backend/.babelrc` to define the Babel runtime configuration and to add extra syntax that Babel can transpile.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/babelrc.json[]
----

Create `backend/src/votes.js` and implement the counting logic by using the asynchronous get and set commands in the @withkoji/database package.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-votes.js[]
----

Add `backend/src/server.js` to create an express server that acts as an entry point to handle backend requests from the frontend.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-server.js[]
----

Add the backend service to `.koji/project/develop.json` so Koji can detect the service.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/develop.json[tags=backend,indent=0]
----

Add the backend service to `.koji/project/deploy.json` to ensure the backend is built and deployed when you publish the template.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/deploy.json[tags=backend,indent=0]
----

Restart your project environment to allow Koji to add the new service to the service map.

* On the left side of the editor, go to *Advanced > Remote environment* and click *Force restart project*.
+
NOTE: Your editor might disconnect during the reboot.
You can reconnect when it has completed.
You should see that a `backend` terminal has been added at the bottom.

=== Install the packages

Install @withkoji/dispatch to add real time, multi-user functionality in your frontend Koji application.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save @withkoji/dispatch
----

Install @withkoji/vcc to expose Visual Customization Controls (VCCs), dynamically update custom values, and display your template correctly in the Koji feed.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save @withkoji/vcc
----

=== Add the template logic

Create `frontend/utils/DataHandler.js` as a utility file to manage the data handling for the application.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-DataHandler.js[tags=**;!*]
----

Initialize `Dispatch` with the `projectId` metadata to identify your Koji application.
Add a listener to monitor the `new_tap` event, which fires whenever a user taps or clicks the icon.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-DataHandler.js[tags=dispatchEvents,indent=0]
----

Periodically get the data from the backend to ensure you have the most up-to-date counts from the database.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-DataHandler.js[tags=fetchVotes,indent=0]
----

Submit vote counts to the backend for long-term storage in the database.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-DataHandler.js[tags=submitVotes,indent=0]
----

When a user taps the icon, increment the counter and emit the `new_tap` event with dispatch to allow other clients to respond to the event.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/db-blueprint-DataHandler.js[tags=addVotes,indent=0]
----

Update the file that contains the main application code.

.React
`frontend/common/App.js`

.Vanilla JS
`frontend/index.js`

Import the required libraries.

[source,javascript]
.React
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=importPackages]
----

[source,javascript]
.Vanilla JS
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterVanilla.js[tags=importPackages]
----

Use `FeedSdk` to display the template in the Koji feed.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=feedSdk]
----

Initialize `DataHandler`.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=initDataHandler]
----

Track the remix state and the number of votes.

[source,javascript]
.React
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=trackState,indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
.Vanilla JS
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterVanilla.js[tags=trackState,indent=0]
----

Set the callback for `DataHandler` to update the total votes.
Set instant remixing to ready to allow remixes and use FeedSdk so your application can be displayed in the Koji feed.

[source,javascript]
.React
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=callDataHandler,indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
.Vanilla JS
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterVanilla.js[tags=callDataHandler,indent=0]
----

Update the rendered output to display the current vote count, and implement tap events for instant remixing and for counting votes.
Use the `instantRemix.onPresentControl` callback to display the VCC controls when users are remixing your application.

[source,javascript]
.React
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=renderTemplate,indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
.Vanilla JS
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterVanilla.js[tags=renderTemplate,indent=0]
----

Apply conditional styling so remixers can easily tell what can be customized.

[source,javascript]
.React
----
include::../_includes/voteCounterReact.js[tags=styles;stylesOnly,indent=0]
----
NOTE: Remove the `pointer-events: none;` property definition from the `Icon` component.

[source,css]
.Vanilla JS
----
.edit {
    border: 2px dashed grey;
}
p {
    color: white;
}
----

=== Add entitlements

Create `.koji/project/entitlements.json` and enable instant remix support and listing in the Koji feed.

[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/entitlements.json[]
----

=== Test

Use the tools in the Koji editor to test template functionality. For example:

* Multi-user experience – On the *Remote* tab, use *Open in new tab* to open the application in multiple tabs and ensure the vote counter remains synchronized.
* Template default view – *Refresh* the *Live preview* tab.
* Conditional styling of editable elements – In the live preview, switch between *Preview* and *Editing* mode.
* VCC targeting – In *Editing* mode, click each editable element.
The corresponding VCC should open.
* Remix functionality – In the JSON file, switch to *Visual* view, and use VCC editor to customize values.
The template should update immediately.
* Template styles on another browser or device – On the *Remote* tab, copy the URL or use the QR code to open a link to the staging server.

TIP: If you want to reset the counter before you publish the template, go to *Advanced > Database*, open the *votes* database view, and delete the test entries.

=== Publish

Click *Publish now* and enter a *Name* (defines the permalink URL to your template), *Description* (displays along with your template on Koji), and other publish settings, as desired. Then, click *Publish*.

When publishing is completed, click the link in the message to view your live template on Koji. Your template is now available to remix and share anywhere on the web. You can create a fun version for yourself and share it on your favorite site to see what your friends make.
