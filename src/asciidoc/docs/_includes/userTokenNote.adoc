= User token

// tag::all[]
A *user token* is created when a logged-in user loads a Koji, and destroyed when the user closes the Koji.
If the user revisits the Koji, a different token is generated.
Tokens are specific to a user and a Koji, so the same user will have different tokens for different Kojis.
// tag::auth-only[]
You can use a token to validate the user's role and authorization grants for the current Koji.
// end::auth-only[]
// end:all[]
