= User token

// tag::all[]
A *user token* is created when a logged-in user loads a Koji app, and destroyed when the user closes the app.
If the user revisits the Koji app, a different token is generated.
Tokens are specific to a user and a Koji app, so the same user will have different tokens for different apps.
// tag::auth-only[]
You can use a token to validate the user's role and authorization grants for the current Koji app.
// end::auth-only[]
// end::all[]
