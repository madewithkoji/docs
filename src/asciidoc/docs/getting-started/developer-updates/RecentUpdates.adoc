[NOTE]
include::../../_includes/coreReleaseNotes.adoc[tag=all]

==== Freeze Keys for data caching

Freeze Keys enable you to cache and purge content in Koji's CDN, dramatically improving the speed and reliability of backend data requests in your Kojis.

* Make a request directly to the Koji CDN and receive a cached response, instead of waiting for the backend to warm up and serve the request.
* Use the `x-koji-freeze-key` header to instruct the CDN to serve a cached response and `KojiBackend.Utilities.unfreeze` to reset the cache.
* Manage multiple routes and cache endpoints.
* The platform automatically handles remix scoping, so you can maintain one set of logic in your templates.

==== File uploads from Koji frontends

The new `Koji.ui.upload` class enables file uploads from the frontend of your Koji directly to your project's CDN.
You can use this method to upload media created or captured by the user as part of the template experience.
For example, recording a video or drawing on a canvas.

==== Additional changes

* Define products that hold transactions in a pending state until you manually capture them.
* Add watermarks or specify cropping constraints for uploaded videos.
* Various fixes and features to improve the usability and functionality of the Core package methods.

=== Koji platform updates

==== Developer experience enhancements for in-app purchases

* In-app purchase products are now registered or updated on any deploy, instead of only when you publish the template from the Koji editor.
* In the debugger, you can now drill into the details of in-app purchase products and receipts.
This feature improves debugging for product definition updates, as well as for the use of custom attributes on receipts.

==== Analytics and usability improvements

* Live analytics are now available for your Kojis.
To see a live count of users (accurate to within 20 seconds), simply tap the *Koji* button on any of your Kojis.

* The main menu, which appears when you tap your profile picture, now shows lifetime views and revenue for your Kojis, as well as more clearly calls out your pending balance.
* On the *Your Kojis* page, the *Revenue* chart now provides the same interactive controls as the *Views* chart.
// end::highlights[]
* The color picker control now saves your three most recently used colors.
* Tapping *Cancel* or *Back* when editing a Koji now returns to the Koji instead of the home page.
* The Koji editor has improved performance for a better experience when editing your code.

==== Changes to withdrawals, refunds, and fees

* Template developers can now determine the fee percentage for in-app purchases in their templates.
The developer receives 60% of the fees collected for all of these transactions.
* Automatic withdrawals are now available for some countries outside the US.
// end::highlights[]
If automatic withdrawals are not supported for your country, you can https://withkoji.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1[contact the Koji team] and we can process your withdrawal manually.
* For refunds of purchases made with a credit or debit card, the balance is now refunded to that debit or credit card, instead of your Koji wallet.
* Evolution/lineage payments are no longer applied.
* Paid subscriptions are no longer available.

==== Bug fixes

* Changing your username from account settings now correctly regenerates your profile.
* Editing a Koji now correctly updates its thumbnail or sharing image.
Sharing images that were previously cached by other services, such as iMessage or Facebook, still might not update.
* In the *Project Details* page, builds now show when they are completed without the need to refresh the page.
Also, build logs now live stream correctly.
* Links to pages on the `withkoji.com` that are not Kojis no longer open in popover views.
* Various layout and styling fixes.
