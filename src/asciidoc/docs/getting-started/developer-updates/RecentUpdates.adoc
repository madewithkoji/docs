==== Freeze Keys for data caching

Freeze Keys enable you to cache and purge content in Koji's CDN, dramatically improving the speed and reliability of backend data requests in your Kojis.

* Make a request directly to the Koji CDN and receive a cached response, instead of waiting for the backend to warm up and serve the request.
* Use the `x-koji-freeze-key` header to instruct the CDN to serve a cached response and `KojiBackend.Utilities.unfreeze` to reset the cache.
* Manage multiple routes and cache endpoints.
* The platform automatically handles remix scoping, so you can maintain one set of logic in your templates.

==== File uploads from Koji frontends

The new `Koji.ui.upload` class enables file uploads from the frontend of your Koji directly to your project's CDN.
You can use this method to upload media created or captured by the user as part of the template experience.
For example, recording a video or drawing on a canvas.

=== Koji platform updates

The following analytics and usability improvements are now available on the Koji platform.

* Live analytics are now available for your Kojis.
To see a live count of users (accurate to within 20 seconds), simply tap the *Koji* button on any of your Kojis.

* The color picker control now saves your three most recently used colors.
* Tapping *Cancel* or *Back* when editing a Koji now returns to the Koji instead of the home page.
