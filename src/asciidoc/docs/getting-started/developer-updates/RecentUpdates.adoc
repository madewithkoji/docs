=== Core package updates

* The following contexts are deprecated: `admin`, `about`, and `sticker`. Apps can provide admin interfaces by managing roles with Identity.

* The `estimatePoses` option is no longer supported for video captures (Koji.ui.capture.video). Apps can process camera input directly, if needed.

* Bug fixes

=== Koji platform updates

* During app customization, `remix.encryptValue` and `remix.decryptValue` can now read and write values from the app's keystore.
+
This allows apps that use secret values, such as locked photos, to be customizable.
