// tag::highlights[]
=== Developer site updates

* To accelerate Koji app development, several articles have been updated, including the following:
** Updated – <<introduction#>>, <<projects#>>, <<editor#>>, <<local-development#>>, <<port-existing-code#>>
** New – <<entitlements#>>

* To make it easier to find the content you need, the site navigation has been streamlined and some deprecated content has been removed.

=== Koji platform updates

* The platform navigation has been updated to support the Koji Profile as a central home for a creator's Koji apps.
Related changes include:

** The Koji button has been replaced with a new floating menu on profiles and a top navigation bar on app.
This new navigation is less invasive and brings the experience of managing a profile or app much close to the app itself.

** Creators can no longer remix apps directly.
Instead, when viewing someone else's app, creators can tap the app name to view the App Store listing and preview or use the app from there.

* You can now make withdrawals from your Koji account without any fees, so you can retain more revenue from your apps.
// end::highlights[]

* For security reasons, your Koji wallet no longer allows topping up.
The Koji wallet appears as a payment option only for a creator who has received funds.
For other users, the Koji wallet will no longer be visible.

* The `estimatePoses` option is no longer supported for video captures.
Apps can process camera input directly, if needed.

* The following contexts and associated entitlements have been deprecated: `admin`, `about`, and `sticker`.
Apps can provide admin interfaces by managing roles with the Identity class in the @withkoji/core package.
// tag::highlights[]

=== Core package updates

* In the <<withkoji-koji-core#>> package, the new `metadata` object provides a reference to the creator's current username and profile picture.
Apps no longer need to collect this data from the user as a configuration option, and users can update their information at the platform level and have it automatically applied in all apps.
+
At runtime, these values are managed by two new environment variables: `KOJI_CREATOR_USERNAME` and `KOJI_CREATOR_PROFILE_PICTURE`.

* Apps can use the new `iap.refundTransaction` method to refund unsettled transactions.
// end::highlights[]

* Apps can use the new `ui.present.systemAlert` method to communicate state changes to users.
