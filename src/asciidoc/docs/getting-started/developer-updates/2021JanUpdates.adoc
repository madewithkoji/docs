== January 15

* For template developers, the following features are now available on the Koji platform.
** The new <<media#,media VCC>> provides a single control for customizing image, file, sound, and video values.
// end::highlights[]
You can configure which of the underlying media types to allow as well as the options for each type.
As part of this change, the <<image#,image VCC>> now supports type options for all Fastly parameters, enabling you to automatically manipulate uploaded images.
// tag::highlights[]
** The new `@initialTransform` key for JSON customization files enables templates to reset specific VCC values when a new remix is created.
// end::highlights[]
For example, in templates for selling items, you might want to reset the product name and description to placeholder text.
See <<vcc-overview#>>.
// tag::highlights[]
** To improve stability and protect against bursts of traffic, requests to Koji backends are now rate limited to 900 requests, per 15 minutes, per IP address.
// end::highlights[]
Rate limits are applied per remix, so a user could make up to 900 requests each to multiple Koji backends in 15 minutes.
Users who send too many requests in quick succession might see error messages with a status code of `429`.
** To improve performance, the Koji debugger now debounces value updates.
* In the <<withkoji-database-package#>> package, the new `increment` method provides an atomic operation for incrementing numeric values in the database with a single `update` request.
* For all creators, the following usability enhancements are available on the Koji platform.
** The new *Manage this Koji* button appears across the top of any Kojis you create and provides easy access to at-a-glance insights and settings.
** The sharing menu has been updated.
** Your Koji profile page is now available from the following automatic links:
+
`\https://koji.to/~name` and `\https://koji.to/@name`
+
(where `name` is your user name on Koji).
** New caching and performance improvements were added to enhance content delivery.

== January 8

* A new https://help.withkoji.com/[Help Center] is now available for finding answers to general platform questions, such as how withdrawals work.
* For template developers, the following new features and navigation updates are available.
** The new project overview page lets you access key information about your templates without loading them in the Koji editor.
// end::highlights[]
For example, open the debugger, or view the build logs, commit history, and other git info.
As part of this enhancement, the *My Repositories* page has changed to *My Projects* and has an updated layout.
To access the project overview for one of your templates, go to https://withkoji.com/developer/projects[My Projects] and click the desired project.

To access it, tap the Koji button, and then tap *Koji Settings*.
** The built-in <<vcc-overview#,Visual Customization Controls>> (VCCs) were updated with a more streamlined look and feel to improve the remixing experience.
** Sharing your Koji profile page on social media now renders a rich preview.
* The following bugs have been fixed.
** When uploading media in a VCC, it is no longer possible to accidentally dismiss the control and cancel the upload.
** Lineage now correctly computes all descendants, instead of only the Kojiâ€™s children.
** Scrolling the Koji home page no longer causes templates to load at the wrong scroll offset.
