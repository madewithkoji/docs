:page-description: Brief digest of updates in 2021 to the Koji platform and developer site.

This digest summarizes updates to the Koji platform, packages, and developer site from earlier in 2021.
For the latest updates, see <<developer-updates#>>.

include::../../_includes/tip-discord-server.adoc[tags=*]

// tag::highlights[]
== May

=== Developer site updates

* To accelerate Koji app development, several articles have been updated, including the following:
** Updated – <<introduction#>>, <<projects#>>, <<editor#>>, <<local-development#>>, <<port-existing-code#>>
** New – <<entitlements#>>

* To make it easier to find the content you need, the site navigation has been streamlined and some deprecated content has been removed.

=== Koji platform updates

* The platform navigation has been updated to support the Koji Profile as a central home for a creator's Koji apps.
Related changes include:

** The Koji button has been replaced with a new floating menu on profiles and a top navigation bar on app.
This new navigation is less invasive and brings the experience of managing a profile or app much close to the app itself.

** Creators can no longer remix apps directly.
Instead, when viewing someone else's app, creators can tap the app name to view the App Store listing and preview or use the app from there.
+
image::appdetails-jun2021.png[App Store listing]

* You can now make withdrawals from your Koji account without any fees, so you can retain more revenue from your apps.
// end::highlights[]

* For security reasons, your Koji wallet no longer allows topping up.
The Koji wallet appears as a payment option only for a creator who has received funds.
For other users, the Koji wallet will no longer be visible.

* Fixed a bug where custom controls would show a loading indicator but would never load.

* Fixed a bug where product SKUs were not correctly resolved on the backend unless they were all lowercase.
Product SKUs are no longer case-sensitive.

* The `estimatePoses` option is no longer supported for video captures.
Apps can process camera input directly, if needed.

* The following contexts and associated entitlements have been deprecated: `admin`, `about`, and `sticker`.
Apps can provide admin interfaces by managing roles with the Identity class in the @withkoji/core package.

* The `FeedEvents` entitlement has been deprecated.
// tag::highlights[]

=== Core package updates

* In the <<withkoji-koji-core#>> package, the new `metadata` object provides a reference to the creator's current username and profile picture.
Apps no longer need to collect this data from the user as a configuration option, and users can update their information at the platform level and have it automatically applied in all apps.
+
At runtime, these values are managed by two new environment variables: `KOJI_CREATOR_USERNAME` and `KOJI_CREATOR_PROFILE_PICTURE`.

* Apps can use the new `iap.refundTransaction` method to refund unsettled transactions.
// end::highlights[]

* Apps can use the new `ui.present.systemAlert` method to communicate state changes to users.

* <<game-intro#>>
* <<game-iap-intro#>>

=== Integrated Core reference docs

The reference documentation for the <<withkoji-koji-core#, @withkoji/core package>> is now integrated into the Koji developer site.
// end::highlights[]

* All of Koji's developer documentation in one place – search everything to find what you need.
* Deep links from the reference documentation to the related package code on Github.
* Organized by class for easier navigation with less clicking.
* Updated code examples for all methods.

=== Core package updates

The following features are now available in the @withkoji/core package.

[NOTE]
include::../../_includes/coreReleaseNotes.adoc[tag=all]

// tag::highlights[]

==== Freeze Keys for data caching

Freeze Keys enable you to cache and purge content in Koji's CDN, dramatically improving the speed and reliability of backend data requests in your Kojis.
// end::highlights[]

* Make a request directly to the Koji CDN and receive a cached response, instead of waiting for the backend to warm up and serve the request.
* Use the `x-koji-freeze-key` header to instruct the CDN to serve a cached response and `KojiBackend.Utilities.unfreeze` to reset the cache.
* Manage multiple routes and cache endpoints.
* The platform automatically handles remix scoping, so you can maintain one set of logic in your templates.
// tag::highlights[]

==== File uploads from Koji frontends

The new `Koji.ui.upload` class enables file uploads from the frontend of your Koji directly to your project's CDN.
You can use this method to upload media created or captured by the user as part of the template experience.
For example, recording a video or drawing on a canvas.

==== Additional changes

* Define products that hold transactions in a pending state until you manually capture them.
* Add watermarks or specify cropping constraints for uploaded videos.
// end::highlights[]
* Various fixes and features to improve the usability and functionality of the Core package methods.

=== Koji platform updates

==== Developer experience enhancements for in-app purchases
// tag::highlights[]

* In-app purchase products are now registered or updated on any deploy, instead of only when you publish the template from the Koji editor.
* In the debugger, you can now drill into the details of in-app purchase products and receipts.
// end::highlights[]
This feature improves debugging for product definition updates, as well as for the use of custom attributes on receipts.

==== Analytics and usability improvements

* Live analytics are now available for your Kojis.
To see a live count of users (accurate to within 20 seconds), simply tap the *Koji* button on any of your Kojis.
+
image::live-analytics-apr2021.png[Live analytics]

* The main menu, which appears when you tap your profile picture, now shows lifetime views and revenue for your Kojis, as well as more clearly calls out your pending balance.

* The color picker control now saves your three most recently used colors.
* Tapping *Cancel* or *Back* when editing a Koji now returns to the Koji instead of the home page.
* The Koji editor has improved performance for a better experience when editing your code.

==== Changes to withdrawals, refunds, and fees
// tag::highlights[]

* Template developers can now determine the fee percentage for in-app purchases in their templates.
The developer receives 60% of the fees collected for all of these transactions.
// end::highlights[]
* Automatic withdrawals are now available for some countries outside the US.
If automatic withdrawals are not supported for your country, you can mailto:support@withkoji.com[contact the Koji team] and we can process your withdrawal manually.
* For refunds of purchases made with a credit or debit card, the balance is now refunded to that debit or credit card, instead of your Koji wallet.
* Evolution/lineage payments are no longer applied.
* Paid subscriptions are no longer available.

==== Bug fixes

* Editing a Koji now correctly updates its thumbnail or sharing image.
Sharing images that were previously cached by other services, such as iMessage or Facebook, still might not update.
* In the *Project Details* page, builds now show when they are completed without the need to refresh the page.
Also, build logs now live stream correctly.
* Links to pages on the `withkoji.com` that are not Kojis no longer open in popover views.

You can set the remix price when you publish a template in the store, and then earn when someone remixes your template.
// end::highlights[]
* The koji VCC type has been renamed to the link VCC type.
The link type now supports an extended result format, which returns the page title, description, and a thumbnail URL that is hosted on the Koji CDN.
// tag::highlights[]
* You can now hide the default action for cancelling a remix, enabling the template to implement its own navigation controls.

* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-koji-core#, @withkoji/core package>>.
** The new `ui.navigate.edit` method enables a template to programmatically enter an edit experience.
** In PlayerState, two new methods (`onFocus` and `onBlur`) and one new property (`hasFocus`) enable templates to respond to the focus state of the Koji.

** In Database, for any method that updates a database entry, an optional `returnDoc` parameter returns the updated entry.
** `Koji.ui.capture.sound` has been replaced with `Koji.ui.capture.audio`.
`Koji.ui.capture.koji` has been replaced with `Koji.ui.capture.link`.
** The `identity.getToken` method now returns a `presumedRole` that can be used in frontend services to provide owner or admin actions in a Koji.
Admin actions must still be secured on the backend by resolving the user's role.
