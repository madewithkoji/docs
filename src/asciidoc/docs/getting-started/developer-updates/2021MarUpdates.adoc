When an upgrade is available, the creater can tap *Upgrade this Koji* on the Koji's analytics page.

The new profile builder features fully customizable backgrounds, buttons, and fonts and provides the same powerful analytics that are built into your Kojis.
** The navigation experience in Kojis has been improved with updates to the modal windows for embedded Kojis, removal of the confirmation prompt when linking to another website, and support for `koji.to` links.

System alerts and the loading spinner have also been updated.
** The Koji theme is no longer available as an account setting.
All accounts now default to the dark theme preference.
** A custom magic link is no longer available as an account setting.

Existing magic links will continue to work; however, they cannot be updated.

The link type now supports an extended result format, which returns the page title, description, and a thumbnail URL that is hosted on the Koji CDN.

** The new `ui.navigate.edit` method enables a template to programmatically enter an edit experience.
** In PlayerState, two new methods (`onFocus` and `onBlur`) and one new property (`hasFocus`) enable templates to respond to the focus state of the Koji.
** In Database, for any method that updates a database entry, an optional `returnDoc` parameter returns the updated entry.
// end::highlights[]
** `Koji.ui.capture.sound` has been replaced with `Koji.ui.capture.audio`.
`Koji.ui.capture.koji` has been replaced with `Koji.ui.capture.link`.
** The `identity.getToken` method now returns a `presumedRole` that can be used in frontend services to provide owner or admin actions in a Koji.
Admin actions must still be secured on the backend by resolving the user's role.
