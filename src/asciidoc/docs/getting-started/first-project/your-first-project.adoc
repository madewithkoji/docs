As in most development projects, a Koji project is the collection of source code and assets that are compiled and packaged to create a Koji app.
In the first section of this tutorial, you will
// tag::description[]
walk through creating your first project by forking an existing one, making minor edits, and then publishing the app.
// end::description[]

In this section, you will learn how to:

* Fork an existing project.
* Open the code editor to view the code in your project and make minor edits.
* Compile and publish the app from the code editor.
* Reopen the project for additional editing.

== Forking an existing project

[quote, Sir Isaac Newton]
If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

Koji is designed with the idea that any new technology is built on other existing technologies.

Koji developers start by forking an existing project or scaffold.
In version control solutions, such as Git, [.term]#forking# means copying the contents of an entire repository to a new repository, which becomes the starting point for a different goal.
You can fork other developers' projects or your own.

When you fork a Koji project, you create a copy that you own.
In your copy, you can change the code, reorganize components, and even remove parts that you don’t like.

In this tutorial, you will fork a scaffold.
Scaffolds are bare-bones projects that include a basic JavaScript framework, as well as the instructions that Koji needs to run the project.

=== Exercise 1.1: Fork the scaffold

. Go to the https://withkoji.com/apps/tutorial-template-koji-quick-start-2873c226[Tutorial Template: Koji Quick Start] details page.

. Fork the project by going to menu:...[Fork].
+

The *Project Details* page opens.

== Viewing and updating the project details

The *Project Details* page shows you information about your project and provides some advanced tools and configuration options.

Notice that the name of your project is the same as the name of the original scaffold.
Customize your project by renaming it.

=== Exercise 1.2: Rename the new project

. To rename your project, click the btn:[Rename].
+
[.img50]
image::tut-1stproj-projdetails-rename.png[In the Project Details page, click the *Rename* button.]

. In the modal, fill in the *Project Name* field.
+
[.img50]
image::tut-1stproj-projdetails-rename.gif[In the modal, enter a new name.]

. Click btn:[Save].

The project name changes to the new name you entered.

=== Exercise 1.3: Open the code editor

. From the *Project Details*, click *Open in Code Editor*.
+
[.img50]
image::tut-1stproj-projdetails-postrename-codeeditor.png[Open in Code Editor]

== Exploring the code editor

include::{includespath}/images-annotated.adoc[tag=editorsections]

=== Exercise 1.4: Edit [.filepath]#README.md#

By default, the README.md tab is initially open in the code editor.
If not, click the *Readme* link in the left navigation pane under *Project*.

[.img50]
image::tut-1stproj-codeeditor-readme.gif[Replace the title of the readme]

. On the tab for [.filepath]#README.md#, toggle to btn:[Code] to edit the file.
. Update the title of the readme to be the same as the new name of your project.
include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-save-or-ctrl-s]

The btn:[Save] button appears whenever the file has unsaved changes.

=== Exercise 1.5: Edit [.filepath]#App.js#

[.img50]
image::tut-1stproj-codeeditor-app-js.png[Edit app.js]

. In the navigation pane, expand menu:frontend[src] and click [.filepath]#App.js#.
+
In the editing pane, a new tab is created for [.filepath]#App.js#.

. Replace the text that the app displays.
+
.. Search for the following line:
+
[source,javascript]
----
<p>Getting Started with Koji</p>
----
+
.. Replace it with:
+
[source,javascript]
----
<p>Having Fun with Koji</p>
----

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-save-or-ctrl-s]

Notice that the preview pane is automatically updated with the new text.

TIP: To close a source file that is open in the editing pane, simply click the *X* icon on that file's tab.

== Publishing your app

The preview displays only a temporary (debug) build of your app, which is hosted in a staging server.
You can share the staging URL with your collaborators for testing and for getting feedback.
However, this build and its associated URL become inaccessible after you close the code editor.

TIP: You can find the staging URL by clicking the remote preview icon (image:remote-preview.svg[]) near the top of the preview pane.
Then copy the URL from the browser's address field.

To release your completed app and obtain a permanent URL, you must publish it.
When you do so, an optimized (release) build of your app is generated and then hosted in a production server.

[NOTE]
====
Publishing your app does not automatically add it to the Koji App Store until you create a listing for it.
Learn more: <<app-store#>>

You can also share the permanent production URL of your app in email or other social media.
====

=== Exercise 1.6: Publish your app

. From the navigation pane, click *Publish Now*.
+
[.img50]
image::code-editor-publish-now.png[Publish Now]
+
The *Changes* section shows the files that were modified.
+
IMPORTANT: Before publishing, check that all changes have been saved in all files that you edited.
Unsaved changes will not be published and are lost when you close the code editor.

. (Optional) Replace the default name and add a description.

. (Optional) Select *Allow Remixing* to allow other developers to fork this project.

. Click *Publish New Version*.

During the build, a progress bar is displayed at the bottom right.

After the build, the progress bar is replaced by a success notification, which includes a link to the permanent URL of your app.
Future versions of your app will have the same URL.

== Your Developer Portal

All the projects you create are listed in your own Developer Portal, where you can open them again for editing.

The Developer Portal also includes additional links:

* *Community* – Many ways to connect with the Koji developer community.
* *Documentation* – This documentation set.
* *My App Templates* – The listings for apps that you added to the Koji App Store. Learn more: <<app-store#>>
* *Access Keys* – Security keys required to access your Koji project locally. Learn more: <<local-development#>>

=== Exercise 1.7: Reopen your project

1. Open a new browser window.

2. Go to your https://withkoji.com/developer/projects[Developer Portal].
+
[.img50]
image::developer-portal.png[Developer Portal]

3. Under *All Projects*, click the project that you created earlier.

The *Project Details* page opens.
This is the same page where you renamed your project and opened the code editor.

[NOTE]
====
Koji handles almost everything you need to deploy and host your app:

[.singlespaced]
* A permalink to access your published app.
* Free hosting of your app.
* Automatic scaling as more users use your app.
* SSL.

== Wrapping up

Congratulations! You've successfully created and published your own Koji app!
You’ve also seen some of the basic parts of the *Project Details* page, the code editor, and the Developer Portal.

In the <<core-package#, next section>>, you'll learn how to incorporate the @withkoji/core package into your project and how to use it to easily add various features to your app.
