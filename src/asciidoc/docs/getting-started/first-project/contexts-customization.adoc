In the <<tutorial-first-app-core-package#,previous topic>> of this tutorial, you learned about using the terminal, and installing and using the @withkoji/core package.
In this topic, you will
// tag::description[]
learn about contexts and how to implement the *Remix* context to enable customization of your app.
// end::description[]

You will learn how to:

[.singlespaced]
* Set your default customization data in the `koji.json` file.
* Manage the customization data using the `get`, `set`, and `finish` methods.
* Determine the user's current context using the `context` property.

== Derivative apps

A Koji app's most compelling feature is its customizability.
A creator can take an existing app, customize it without coding, and publish the customized version.
Another creator can take the customized version and create another customized version the same way.

As the developer of the original app, you can choose to enable this feature.

To experience how a creator might customize your Koji app, try customizing the Bouncy Blast game.

=== Exercise 3.1: (Optional) Create your own customized Bouncy Blast

include::{includespath}/steps-app-store.adoc[tag=go2-app-store-bouncy-blast]

. (Optional) Click btn:[Preview] to play with the original version.

. Click btn:[Use] to customize the app.
(If you played with the original version, click btn:[Use App] at the bottom of the preview.)

. Click on any of the customizable components to replace the component.
+

+
The preview is immediately updated with your selection.

. Click btn:[Preview].

. In the *Publish App* page, click on the screenshot to play your customized version of the game.
+

. (Optional) Tip the original developer.

. To publish your customized version, click btn:[Publish].

Your customized version is displayed.

The URL in the browser address field is the permanent link for your customized version.
You can add this link to your Koji profile or share it in any social media.

[TIP]
====
To view all your published apps (original and customized versions),

. Click your profile image to expand the player menu.
. Select *Your Apps*.

== Quick introduction to contexts

A web app can have multiple views or modes for different purposes.
In Koji, these views or modes are called [.term]#contexts#.

This tutorial uses the two most commonly used contexts:

[.singlespaced]
* *Default* – The default experience for a Koji app. Each app always has a default context.
* *Remix* – The mode in which a creator can customize an existing app.

The context changes depending on actions taken by the user.
Your app can determine what the current context is and then display the view for that context.

== Implementing the *Remix* context

For efficiency, most web applications, such as Facebook, Gmail, and Reddit, load the same basic JavaScript code and run it in a browser.
They rely on user-specific data to deliver a slightly different experience to each user.
The user-specific data is typically stored in a database, which is separate from the code.

Similarly, every customized version of a Koji app loads and runs the same code that the original developer wrote.
What differentiates a customized version from the original and from each other is the set of customization settings, which is stored in a database and is separate from the code.

To create a customizable Koji app, you must:

[.singlespaced]
* Decide which components would be customizable.
* Implement the *Remix* context, where you can collect the custom values from the user.
* Store the custom values in Koji's database.

When published, the app with customized settings becomes a new customized version, and it gets its own production URL, which is different from the parent app's URL.

=== Exercise 3.2: Display the capture button in the *Remix* context

In a previous exercise, you added a btn:[Capture Image] button that replaces the rotating image.
However, the value is not saved after the app stops running.

To make the rotating image a customizable component, its value must be updated in the *Remix* context and saved in the customization data.

In this exercise, you will move the btn:[Capture Image] button from the *Default* context to the *Remix* context.

By displaying the image in the *Remix* context, the user gets a visual confirmation of the image they selected.

<2> If in the *Remix* context, displays the btn:[Capture Image] button.
<3> Removed the btn:[Capture Image] button from the *Default* context.

. Test the contexts by clicking the similarly named tabs at the top of the preview pane.
+
The *Capture Image* button appears in the *Remix* tab but not in the *Default* tab.

. (Optional) Test the *Capture Image* button.
+
You will add code in a later exercise to save the URL of the new image.

== Default values for customizable components

The original version of any app includes default values for all customizable components.
This ensures that the app performs as intended even before it is customized.
You can specify these default values in the [.filepath]#koji.json# file of your project.

In the customized version of the app, the parent version's values are overridden by the new customized values.
If a component is not customized, its value is copied from the parent version.

Settings for the customized version of the app are stored in and loaded from the Koji database.

=== Exercise 3.3: Specify default values for customizable components

To specify the default values for your app's customizable components, add a `remixData` key to the [.filepath]#koji.json# file.

  },
  "remixData": {
    "spinningImageSrc": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg"
  }
}
----
+
The `remixData` object in this example contains only one key-value pair which will be used as the initial value for `logoSrc`:
+
[source,json]
----
"spinningImageSrc": “https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg"
----

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-save-or-ctrl-s]

You already added a line in [.filepath]#index.js# to import [.filepath]#koji.json# to retrieve other settings.
That import will also make the `remixData` values available to your app.

== Retrieving customization data

Currently, in [.filepath]#App.js#, `logoSrc` is directly assigned a literal URL as its initial value.
Therefore, the image reverts to the same initial image when the app refreshes or displays a new page.

Now that the customization data is set up in [.filepath]#koji.json#, your app can retrieve the value of `spinningImageSrc` using `Koji.remix.get`.
Then you can set `logoSrc` to that value instead of the literal URL.

[NOTE]
====
If the running app is the original version, the customization data contains the original values that you specified in [.filepath]#koji.json#.

If the running app is a customized version, the customization data contains the values that were selected during customization.
====

=== Exercise 3.4: Retrieve from remixData.spinningImageSrc

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=open-file-app-js]

. Replace the `logoSrc` assigment to use the value of `remixData.spinningImageSrc`.
+
.. Search for the following line:
+
[source,javascript]
----
const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg');
----
+
.. Replace it with:
+
[source,javascript]
----
const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState(Koji.remix.get().spinningImageSrc);
----

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-save-or-ctrl-s]

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-refresh-icon]

The same spinning image is displayed.
However, instead of hard-coding the default value, you’re using `Koji.remix.get()` to retrieve the value from the `koji.json` file.

== Saving customization data

Previously, you added a user-input control to allow the user to upload or select an image.
However, the image URL returned by that control is not saved permanently.

To save changes to the customization data, use `Koji.remix.set`.

=== Exercise 3.5: Save to remixData.spinningImageSrc

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=open-file-app-js]

. Replace the `captureImage` function to look as follows:
+
[source, javascript]
----
const captureImage = async () => {
  const src = await Koji.ui.capture.image();
  if (src) {
    setLogoSrc(() => src);  // <1>
    await Koji.remix.set({ spinningImageSrc: src });  // <2>
  }
};
----
<1> `logoSrc` is still updated to give the user a visual confirmation of the image they selected.
<2> Saves the Koji URL of the selected image as the value for the key `spinningImageSrc` in the customization data.

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=click-save-or-ctrl-s]

Because you saved the new URL to the customization data as soon as the image was selected, the change is effective in your entire app immediately.
The user remains in the *Remix* context.

== Returning to the *Default* context

To give the user a way to return to the *Default* context, you can create a btn:[Done] button that calls a function with `Koji.remix.finish`.

=== Exercise 3.6: Returning to the *Default* context

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=open-file-app-js]

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=modify-file-to-look-as-follows]

----
import Koji from '@withkoji/core';
import { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState(Koji.remix.get().spinningImageSrc);

  const captureImage = async () => {
    const src = await Koji.ui.capture.image();

    if (src) {
      setLogoSrc(() => src);
      await Koji.remix.set({ spinningImageSrc: src });
    }
  };

  const finish = async () => {  // <1>
    await Koji.remix.finish();
  };

  if (Koji.playerState.context === 'remix') {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logoSrc} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <button onClick={captureImage}>Capture Image</button>
          <button onClick={finish}>Done</button>  // <2>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logoSrc} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>Having Fun with Koji</p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
----
<1> Handles clicks to the btn:[Done] button.
<2> btn:[Done] button that the user clicks to return to the *Default* context.
