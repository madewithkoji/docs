Welcome to Koji!

This quick start topic guides you through creating your first project in the Koji IDE and developing your first Koji app.
You must be comfortable with developing web applications.

* If you are new to Koji and have minimal or no web development experience, go through <<quick-start#, the Koji quick-start tutorial for beginners>> instead.
* If you prefer to work locally, follow the <<work-locally#,Working locally>> instructions.
