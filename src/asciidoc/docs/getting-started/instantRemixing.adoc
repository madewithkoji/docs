:page-description: Remixing enables creators to evolve Kojis by customizing elements and publishing their own version.

Remixing enables creators to make their own Kojis by customizing elements of existing Kojis and publishing their own versions.
The Koji platform supports the following methods of remixing:

* *Instant remixing* – Opens a template preview with simple controls for changing specific elements, without coding.
As a template developer, you can implement instant remixing to empower everyday users and to increase the template's adoption and value.
* *Forking* – Creates a clone of the underlying project and opens it in the Koji editor.
As a developer, you can fork a scaffold or an existing template, and then introduce your own code and functionality to create a new template.
For more information about forking, read about <<templates#, the template development process>>.

As a Koji evolves over time through remixing, Koji tracks this lineage, and you retain a stake in the value of the "evolution pool."

== Instant remixing for creators

Instant remixing enables users to customize values directly from the template preview, for a quick and easy way to remix without coding.
The following steps describe the general experience for a creator when remixing a Koji.

=== 1. Discover it

Creators can discover and remix a Koji anywhere it is published or shared, whether they find it on https://withkoji.com[withkoji.com], on Facebook, Instagram, or another social site, embedded on a website, or from a direct link.

=== 2. Remix it

When viewing a Koji on any mobile or desktop device, the creator taps the *Koji* button in the top right, and then taps *Remix this Koji*.

The template opens in remix view and exposes any controls or indicators that the developer has provided for remixers.
For example, when developing the remix view for a template, you might highlight the remixable text and image elements and provide buttons to change sounds or background elements.

When the creator taps a remixable element or a button, the related control opens and enables the creator to customize the values.
To provide these controls in your templates, you can use the built-in Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) on the Koji platform for standard elements, such as images, text, and sounds.
To provide more specialized customization types, you can develop custom VCCs or other types of controls.

=== 3. Share it

After customizing the desired values, the creator can preview the template before finalizing it.
Optionally, the creator can add a caption or set the visibility to `unlisted` (accessible by direct link only).

When the creator finalizes their changes, a new Koji is published and is immediately available to share anywhere on the internet, without coding or DevOps.
The creator can simply copy the direct link and paste it into any social media, email, or messenger service.
Or, the creator can tap the *Koji* button, and then tap *Share* to use additional options for easily sharing the link or accessing the embed code.

The creator's network can now view and interact with the new Koji.
For example, they might contribute to the creator's cause, if the Koji is collecting donations, or play the creator's custom game.
Additionally, anyone who discovers the new Koji can remix it, starting the remix process again and adding to the lineage of the template.

== Lineage and evolution

As a Koji evolves over time through remixing, Koji tracks this lineage and makes it available to viewers.
For any Koji, you can trace its history as well as the subsequent versions it inspired.

To see a summary of the lineage for any Koji, tap the *Koji* button, and then tap *More > Developer Tools*.

As an evolution pool grows, Koji distributes the "value" of the iterations across the lineage.
This value can be derived from platform experiences, such as discovery, search, ranking, and content analysis, and from monetary compensation.
For example, if a template performs in-app purchases or other transactions, the platform disburses a percentage of the transaction value across the evolution pool.

To see the complete lineage, including the cap table for transactional values, open the summary, and then tap *See Details*.
