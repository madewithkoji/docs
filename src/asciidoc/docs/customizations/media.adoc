:page-description: Standard VCC for selecting an image, file, sound, or video.
:figure-caption!:

* Users can
//tag::description[]
select an image, file, sound, or video either by selecting from the available options, uploading, or entering a URL.
//end::description[]
* `image`, `video`, `file`, and `sound` VCC types are still supported and will continue to be supported, however, behind the scenes they are now powered by the `media` VCC type.
* The same notes that apply to the individual `image`, `video`, `file`, and `sound` VCC types apply when using `media`.
For example, if you use `media` to load an image through the *Upload* section, the image can be resized or the background can be removed and the image will be stored with the application.
Go to the documentation for the specific media type to see the notes for that type: <<image#>>, <<file#>>, <<sound#>>, <<video#>>.

== Hiding Extensions in media VCC

TheÂ `media` VCC type enables you to hide all asset packs and VCC extensions in cases where they don't make sense (for example, templates for selling premium assets).
To use this feature in your templates, enable the `hideExtensions` type option.
In the following code sample, extensions are hidden, so *Browse Image Asset Packs* will not appear as a selection.

[source,json]
----
{
    "key": "hideExtensions",
    "name": "Image or Video No Extensions",
    "type": "media",
    "typeOptions": {
        "acceptOnly": ["image", "video"],
        "hideExtensions": true,
        "videoOptions": {
        "hls": true
        }
    }
}
----

The sample code will display the following selections.
