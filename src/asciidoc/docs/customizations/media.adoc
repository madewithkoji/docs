* Users can
//tag::description[]
select an image, file, sound, or video either by selecting from the available options, uploading, or entering a URL.
//end::description[]
* The `media` VCC type allows you to use one VCC type to capture multiple types of content and automatically handle transcoding/editing for different types of content.
* `image`, `video`, `file`, and `sound` VCC types are still supported and will continue to be supported, however, behind the scenes they are now powered by the `media` VCC type.
* The same notes that apply to the individual `image`, `video`, `file`, and `sound` VCC types apply when using `media`.
For example, if you use `media` to load an image through the *Upload* section, the image can be resized or the background can be removed and the image will be stored with the application.
Go to the documentation for the specific media type to see the notes for that type:
