* Users can

upload video files.
//end::description[]
* Uploaded videos are automatically compressed and cropped for optimal playback across devices.
Videos are cropped relative to the original aspect ratio, for a resulting aspect ratio of 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (portrait).
* By default, uploaded videos are transcoded to .mp4 format.
* For delivery of longer content, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) can be enabled by passing an optional `typeOption`.
When enabled, uploaded videos are transcoded for HLS and return an m3u8 playlist.
Use this feature in conjunction with https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/[hls.js] for controlling playback.
* Pose detection data can be generated by passing an optional `typeOption`.
When specified, pose data is available after upload by appending `.poses` to the returned URL.
For example, `\https://objects.koji-cdn.com/project-id/my-video.mp4.poses`.
* A thumbnail for the uploaded video is available by appending `00001.png` to the returned URL.
