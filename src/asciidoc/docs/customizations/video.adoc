:page-description: Standard VCC for uploading video files with automatic transcoding and formatting.
:figure-caption!:

--
* Users can
//tag::description[]
upload video files.
//end::description[]
* Use `video` when you want to limit the user to selecting a video file.
To allow multiple types of media files, see <<media#, media>>.
To allow upload of raw files of any type, see <<file#, file>>.
* Using a `video` VCC is equivalent to using a media VCC with `acceptOnly` set to `["video"]`.
* Uploaded videos are automatically compressed and cropped for optimal playback across devices.
Videos are cropped relative to the original aspect ratio, for a resulting aspect ratio of 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (portrait).
* By default, uploaded videos are transcoded to .mp4 format.
* For delivery of longer content, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) can be enabled by including `"hls": true` in `typeOptions`.
When enabled, uploaded videos are transcoded for HLS and return an m3u8 playlist.
Use this feature in conjunction with https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/[hls.js] for controlling playback.
* A thumbnail for the uploaded video is available by appending `00001.png` to the returned URL.
