--
* Users can
//tag::description[]
select an image by selecting from the available options, uploading, or entering a URL.
//end::description[]
* If the image is loaded through the *Upload* section, the image can be resized or the background can be removed and the image will be stored with the application.
* If the image is loaded through the *Advanced* section, the application will use the image at the specified URL. Keep in mind that if the link dies, the image will not appear.
* Remember to keep images small as larger images will take much longer to load.
