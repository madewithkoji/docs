:page-description: Standard VCC for uploading a file.
:figure-caption!:

--
* User can
//tag::description[]
upload any file.
//end::description[]
* You should use `file` if you want the user to be able to select a file that is not an image, video, or audio file.
Otherwise, use an <<image#, image>>, <<video#, video>>, <<sound#, sound>>, or <<media#, media>> VCC.
* Using a `file` VCC is equivalent to using a <<media#, media VCC>> with `acceptOnly` set to `["file"]`.
