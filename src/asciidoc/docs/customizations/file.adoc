:page-description: Standard VCC for uploading a file.
:figure-caption!:

* User can
//tag::description[]
upload any file.
//end::description[]
* Use the `file` type to enable users to upload raw files in their original format.
For example, to offer high-resolution images for download rather than for display in a browser.
* To apply automatic transcoding and transformations for specific file types, use the associated VCC.
See <<image#, image>>, <<video#, video>>, <<sound#, sound>>, or <<media#, media>>.
* Using a `file` VCC is equivalent to using a <<media#, media VCC>> with `acceptOnly` set to `["file"]`.
