:page-description: Configuring the settings and loading assets for a falling objects game.
:figure-caption!:

In the first section of this tutorial, you will
// tag::description[]
fork the game template and modify it to load the images and sounds used in the falling objects game.
// end::description[]

By the end of the section, you should feel comfortable:

* Configuring asset data in the `koji.json` file.
* Using the game template to load assets and define settings.

== About the starting template

The https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[Game Template] is a great starting point for this project because it was created specifically for these types of hyper-casual games.
It handles a lot of what the game needs to do, which saves quite a bit of development time.
For example, the template provides:

* Automatic sound loading.
* Improved image loading with optimization.
* Integrated live leaderboard without the need to modify any of the backend files.
* Easily configurable remix menu.
* One-line calls for spawning special effects, like particles and animated text.

For more information, check out the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1/details/code#README.md[template README].

== Forking the game template

Get started by cloning the game template to your own project.

. Open the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[game template].
. {blank}
include::../../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
+
A copy of the project is created in your Koji account, and the *Project Details* page for your new project is displayed.
. Click *Open in Code Editor*.
+
The Koji editor opens with the game code loaded.

== Configuring koji.json

The falling objects game needs images to represent the player (character) and collectible (falling) objects.

image:https://images.koji-cdn.com/5f618aa2-e515-49a1-adb2-42dfb88a6f59/userData/1d6jr-donut.png[title="Collectible", alt="collectible donut",width=128,height=128]

The game also needs sounds to play when the player collects or misses a falling object.

To define these assets and other game-specific data, you can modify the `koji.json` file.

Open the `koji.json` file, which is located in the project root.
Then, find the `remixData` object.
Update it to add the URL paths for the images and sounds as follows.

[source, json]
----
"remixData": {
  "musicVolume": 0.25,
  ...
  "title": "My Awesome Game",
  "imgLife": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/c166301e-e9be-4a9c-8d08-aaffe23d82bb/userData/3z6gw-life.png",
  "imgPlayer": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/x0kfr-player.png",
  "imgCollectible": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/5f618aa2-e515-49a1-adb2-42dfb88a6f59/userData/1d6jr-donut.png",
  "sndCollect": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/ydx3v-collect01onlineaudioconverter.com.mp3.mp3",
  "sndLoseLife": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/vqnq8-loseLife.mp3.mp3"
},
----

TIP: The game template contains code that automatically loads any sound file whose name begins with `snd`.
You can save yourself some work by following that naming convention.

To give the game a more distinctive look, modify the `title` and `backgroundImage` entries as follows.

[source, json]
----
"remixData": {
  ...
  "music": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/45cdb5ca-8318-4318-8271-d0e422e790e0/hjdo0-music.mp3",
  "title": "Catch The Donuts",
  "backgroundImage": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/377f7596-8edf-44b1-994d-f9926b3aa641/userData/682dt-G68b11.png",
  ...
},
----

The `remixData` object should now look something like this example.

[source,json]
----
"remixData": {
  "music": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/45cdb5ca-8318-4318-8271-d0e422e790e0/hjdo0-music.mp3",
  "musicVolume": 0.25,
  "title": "Catch The Donuts",
  "backgroundImage": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/377f7596-8edf-44b1-994d-f9926b3aa641/userData/682dt-G68b11.png",
  "imgParticles": [
    "https://images.koji-cdn.com/d4d2aab7-1847-481d-8aa6-6866d81d5e0f/6ik7b-star1.png",
    "https://images.koji-cdn.com/d4d2aab7-1847-481d-8aa6-6866d81d5e0f/xvpr0-star3.png",
    "https://images.koji-cdn.com/d4d2aab7-1847-481d-8aa6-6866d81d5e0f/0pfca-start2.png",
    "https://images.koji-cdn.com/d4d2aab7-1847-481d-8aa6-6866d81d5e0f/mwf5o-star5.png"
  ],
  "particle": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/d4d2aab7-1847-481d-8aa6-6866d81d5e0f/zfnue-particle2.png",
  "imgLife": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/c166301e-e9be-4a9c-8d08-aaffe23d82bb/userData/3z6gw-life.png",
  "imgPlayer": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/x0kfr-player.png",
  "imgCollectible": "https://images.koji-cdn.com/5f618aa2-e515-49a1-adb2-42dfb88a6f59/userData/1d6jr-donut.png",
  "sndCollect": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/ydx3v-collect01onlineaudioconverter.com.mp3.mp3",
  "sndLoseLife": "https://objects.koji-cdn.com/814f445d-4e8d-40cb-83fe-04d120cc1889/userData/vqnq8-loseLife.mp3.mp3"
},

NOTE: Don't forget to save your changes.

If you have a Live Preview running, notice that the background image has already changed, as well as the player image in the main menu!

== Loading assets

Now that you've added assets to `remixData`, you need to load them in the game.
The game template loads all of these assets in the `frontend/src/Components/Game/preload.js` file.

You don't have to do anything to load the sounds.
Because you used the `snd` naming convention, the template will load them automatically.

To load images, you use the `addImage()` function from the template.
Update `preload` as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
const preload = () => {
  ...
  const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
  ...
  addImage('player', remixValues.imgPlayer, game.playerSize);
  addImage('collectible', remixValues.imgCollectible, 100);
  ...
}
----

Next, you need to define the value for the `game.playerSize` variable, which represents the size of the player image.
You can define this variable, and other game settings, in the `initializeValues()` function.

Because there's a considerable difference between mobile and desktop display sizes, use the `isMobile()` function to set the `playerSize` according to the device, as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
import isMobile from '../../Utils/isMobile'
...
const initializeValues = () => {
    ...
    game.playerSize = isMobile() ? 90 : 110;
}
----

You can also change the game instructions by modifying the `game.instructions` property.
For example:

`game.instructions = "Touch to move around!";`

== Wrapping up

In this section, you made your own copy of the game template.
Then, you configured the starting values for game settings and loaded the image and sound assets into the game.

In the <<game-creating-game-objects#,next section>>, you'll add the `Player` and `Collectible` classes and use them to represent the character and falling objects in the game.
