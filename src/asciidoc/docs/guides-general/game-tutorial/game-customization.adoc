:page-description: Modifying the remix menu for a falling objects game so that anyone can customize it.
:figure-caption!:

In the <<game-managing-difficulty#, previous section>> of the customizable game tutorial, you finished adding the main functionality for a falling objects game.
But, there's more to do to get the most from Koji.

In this section, youâ€™ll
// tag::description[]
make the game easily customizable by other people so it can be shared everywhere online.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Editing the customization menu in the game scaffold.
* Adding a customizable image to the menu.

== Exploring the customization menu

The game scaffold provides a configurable customization menu to speed up game development on Koji.

If you open `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`, you'll see that some of the workflow you need for your game is already set up.

NOTE: To see what the customization menu currently looks like, use the *Remix* tab of the <<testing-apps#_using_the_koji_debugger, Debugger>> or the Live Preview in the Koji editor.

The background image and music customizations are already handled by the scaffold, so you can just leave them as they are.

Because you added the player functionality to the existing `Player` class, which already uses `imgPlayer` for its image, the player is also set up to be customizable.

To test it out, try changing the player image.
If necessary, refresh the preview.
The player is different now!

== Adding collectibles to the customization menu

You can make the collectible image customizable, as well.

=== Setting up state hooks

First, make a state hook that will represent the collectible image, and assign the initial value.
Modify `index.js` as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
...
const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [imgCollectible, setImgCollectible] = useState("");
    const [isCollectibleInvalid, setIsCollectibleInvalid] = useState("");
    ...

    const assignInitialValues = () => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        setImgCollectible(remixValues.imgCollectible);

        ...
    })
}
----

Notice that you also created an `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook.
You'll use this hook to make sure the user has actually uploaded an image, so the game won't be published without one.

Also notice the change to the `assignInitialValues()` function, which is in the useEffect hook that runs when the `Remix` component mounts.
Here, you assigned the initial value from `koji.json`.

=== Changing the image

You also need to define functions for changing or deleting the collectible image.

[source,javascript]
----
...
const Component = () => {
    ...

    const changeCollectible = async () => {
        const imageUrl = await Koji.ui.capture.image();
        if (!imageUrl || imageUrl === "") return;

        setImgCollectible(imageUrl);
        setIsCollectibleInvalid(false);
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: imageUrl })
        updateGame();
    }

    const deleteCollectible = async () => {
        setImgCollectible("");
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: "" })
        updateGame();
    }

    ...
}
----

In `changeCollectible`, the code uses the `Koji.ui.capture.image()` method from the @withkoji/core package to capture the image.
This method lets users select an image by uploading it, pasting it from a link, or selecting it from the asset packs.
It will return `null` if the user cancels image selection, so the code includes a simple check to make sure that's not the case.

Then, the code does the following:

* Updates the `imgCollectible` state hook with the resulting image.
* Resets the `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook.
* Updates the `imgCollectible` customization value with the resulting image.
* Updates the game.

This code updates the game because the user has a running game preview behind the customization menu.
If you change a customization value that isn't instantly previewable in the game, this step can be skipped.

In `deleteCollectible()`, the code works similarly, except it sets `imgCollectible` to an empty string instead of capturing an image.

=== Rendering the image component

Next, you need to render the component that represents a collectible image in the customization menu to enable users to customize the image.
You can once again use the existing structure from `Player`.

Find the component that looks like the following.

[source,javascript]
----
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Player"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgPlayer, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeImgPlayer}
        onDelete={deletePlayer}
        isInvalid={isPlayerInvalid}
    />
</div>
----

Make a copy just below it, in the same `<Section>` component.
Modify the copy as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Collectible"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgCollectible, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeCollectible}
        onDelete={deleteCollectible}
        isInvalid={isCollectibleInvalid}
    />
</div>
----

=== Making sure the image is selected

Lastly, you need to modify the `finish()` function to prevent the user from publishing if they haven't uploaded an image.

That logic is already in place for `imgPlayer`, so you can just modify it to include `imgCollectible` as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
const finish = async () => {
    if (imgPlayer === "" || imgCollectible === "") {
        setErrorLabel("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (imgPlayer === "") {
            setIsPlayerInvalid(true);
        }

        if (imgCollectible === "") {
            setIsCollectibleInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
    })
    Koji.remix.finish();
}
----

NOTE: You don't need to explicitly set `imgPlayer` and `imgCollectible` in the `Koji.remix.set()` function because you've already done it in the `onChange` handlers.

== Wrapping up

You've just added the ability for users to change the collectible image.
The customization menu is complete!

In the <<game-thumbnail-preview#, next section>>, you will customize the preview image that is displayed when sharing the game.
