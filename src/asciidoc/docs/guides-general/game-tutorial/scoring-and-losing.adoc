:page-description: Adding collision checks for scoring and conditions for losing a falling objects game.
:figure-caption!:

In the <<game-creating-game-objects#,previous section>> of the customizable game tutorial, you added the player and the collectibles to the falling objects game.
In this section, you’ll
// tag::description[]
enable the player to catch a falling collectible and add the logic for scoring and losing the game.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Checking for a collision between the player and a collectible and adding to the game score when a collectible has been caught.
* Adding simple animations.
* Taking away a life from the player when a collectible has been missed.

== Checking for collisions

To determine when the player has caught a falling object, you can check for collisions between the player and the collectibles.
Then, add to the score every time a collision happens.

In `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js`, add a new function to check for collisions.
Then, call the function from `update()`.

[source,javascript]
----
...
import { CollisionCircle } from '../Utils/Collision'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkCollisions();
    }

    checkCollisions() {
        const collectibles = game.findByTag('collectible');

        collectibles.forEach(collectible => {
            if (!collectible.isCollected && CollisionCircle(this, collectible)) {
                collectible.onCollect();
            }
        });
    }
}
----

This code uses `game.findByTag('collectible')` to get all of the `Collectible` objects.
Then, the code checks each collectible to see whether it's colliding with the `Player`.

NOTE: The `game.findByTag(tag: string)` function works by filtering the game instance's `entities` array, and then returning an array that contains all entities with the given tag.

To check for a collision, the code uses the `CollisionCircle()` function from `frontend/src/Components/Game/Utils/Collision.js`.
This function takes two `Entities` as arguments and returns `true` if they are close enough together to collide (based on the size of the entities and their distance apart).

If the player is colliding with a collectible and the collectible in question hasn't already been collected, the code triggers the `onCollect()` handler.
You need to define the `onCollect()` handler in `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js`.
This function sets the `isCollected` flag to `true`.

[source,javascript]
----
...

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...


    onCollect() {
        this.isCollected = true;
    }
}
----

== Adding animations for collecting objects

When a collectible object is caught, you could simply remove it from the game.
But, let's spice things up a bit!

The game scaffold has lots of effects that can make this game even more fun.
Instead of the collectible simply disappearing upon contact, you can have the player attract it like a magnet and make it explode into particles.

To add these animations, override the `update()` function in `Collectible.js`, but keep the original behavior, which is defined in the parent Entity class.

[source,javascript]
----
// Don't forget the imports!
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import playSound from '../Utils/playSound'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
import { spawnParticles } from '../Effects/Particle'
import { spawnFloatingText } from '../Effects/FloatingText'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    onCollect() {
        this.isCollected = true;
    }

    update(){
        super.update();
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta() * 4;

        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);

        this.moveTowardsPlayer();

        if (this.animTimer >= 1) this.getCollected();
    }

    moveTowardsPlayer() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8);
        this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8);
        this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12);
        this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12);
    }

    getCollected() {
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;

        spawnParticles(game.player.pos.x, game.player.pos.y, 10, { img: this.img });

        const x = game.player.pos.x;
        const y = game.player.pos.y - game.player.size * 0.75;

        spawnFloatingText("+1", x, y);
        game.addScore(1)
        playSound(game.sounds.collect);
        game.player.pulse();
    }
}
----

At this point, the player's `pulse()` function has not been defined, so the game will crash when there's a collision.
Before adding this function, take a closer look at how the animation code works.

After the `isCollected` value is set to `true`, things start to happen.

The `handleAnimation()` function does the following:

* Advances the `animTimer` property by `game.delta() * 4`.
+
Using `game.delta() * 4` means that the `animTimer` is incremented by `1` every `0.25` seconds.
The higher the multiplier, the faster the timer is incremented.
[NOTE]
Here's a more detailed explanation of how the timer works.
Multiplying the delta by a number increments `animTimer` faster according to the multiplier.
So, `game.delta() * 2`  increases `animTimer` by 1 in half a second, game.delta() * 4  increases it by 1 in a quarter of a second, and so on.
Internally, `delta()` calls `1 / game.frameRate()`, which gives us the time passed since the last frame was rendered.
So, if you're running at 60 frames per second, 60 * (1 / frameRate()) = 1.

* Uses the `animTimer` value to apply some `EasingFunctions` that shrink the scale from 1 to 0.05.
+
Going all the way down to `0` might create some minor glitches.
Instead, use a tiny value, which doesn't make any difference visually.

At the same time, the `moveTowardsPlayer()` function does several things at once.

* `this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8)` – Gradually decreases the existing vertical velocity.

* `this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8)` – Starts spinning wildly.

* `this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12)` and `this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12)` – Quickly moves toward the player location.

After `animTimer` reaches `1` (in about `0.25` seconds, since you're multiplying the delta by `4`), the easing animation will be over, and that's when the actual collecting happens with `getCollected()`.

The `getCollected()` function does the following:

* Sets the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`.
+
This game scaffold already has code that handles removal of entities when the `shouldBeRemoved` flag is set, so that's all you need to do.

* Spawns `10` particles at the player's position and uses the same image as the `Collectible`.

* Spawns a `+1` floating text a little above the player.

* Adds `1` to the game score.

* Plays the `collect` sound.

* Calls `game.player.pulse()`, which resets the player's `pulse` animation.

To set up the `pulse` animation, make the following changes to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js`.

[source,javascript]
----
// Don't forget to import `Ease` and `EasingFunctions`.
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
import { CollisionCircle } from '../Utils/Collision'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    update(){
        ...
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (this.animTimer > 1) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta();

        const intensity = 0.3;
        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 + intensity, -intensity);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 - intensity, +intensity);
    }

    pulse() {
        this.animTimer = 0;
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
Remember when you assigned the `game.player` property to the `gameInstance`?
You make use of it here.
Another way to find the player object would be to set the `"player"` tag inside of `Player`, then use something like `const player = game.findByTag('player')[0];`.

As you can see, this code is similar to the animation setup in `Collectible`.

You increment the `animTimer` property as long as it's below `1`, because the `EasingFunctions` only work for values between `0` and `1`.
Then, you modify the scale again.
In this case, you're using the `easeOutElastic` function, which generates a nice bouncy effect.

The `pulse()` function just resets the `animTimer` to `0`, which restarts the animation.

Now it's looking better!

== Checking for missed collectibles

You need to add a way to lose the game, too!
If a collectible falls to the bottom without getting caught, you can take away a life from the player.
When the player loses all its lives, the game ends.

To implement this logic for losing the game, you first have to check if any of the collectibles went past the player and off the screen.

Open `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js` and add the following code.

[source,javascript]
----
import { game } from '..'
...

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkIfMissed();
    }

    checkIfMissed() {
        if (game.gameOver) return;

        const isBelowScreen = this.pos.y > game.height + this.size / 2;
        if (isBelowScreen) this.onMiss();
    }

    onMiss() {
        game.loseLife();
        playSound(game.sounds.loselife);
        game.camera.shake(0.25, 12);
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;
    }
}
----

This code checks the Collectible's `pos.y` coordinate.
If it's higher than the lower edge of the screen, it triggers the `onMiss()` function.

The `onMiss()` funtion does the following:

* Triggers a `game.loseLife` function.
+
The scaffold automatically ends the game when there are no lives left.

* Plays a `loselife` sound.

* Shakes the camera a bit to amplify the negative effect.

* Sets the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`, so that the object will be deleted from memory in the next frame.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Deleting unused objects from memory is an especially important step in every game to prevent memory leaks, which can result in a performance slowdown and, eventually, a crash.

== Wrapping up

Your game is now playable!

In this section, you enabled the player to catch objects, which increases the game score.
You also removed a life when the player misses an object, which eventually leads to losing the game.

In the <<game-managing-difficulty#,next section>>, you'll add some difficulty management, so that the game gets progressively harder as it's played.
