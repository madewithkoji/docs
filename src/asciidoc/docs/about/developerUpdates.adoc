== 2020

=== December 15

* The following features are now available on the Koji platform.
** The <<video#,video VCC>> can now support HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) for delivery of longer content, such as courses and short films.
To use this feature in your templates, enable the `hls` type option.
** Creators can now publish subscription-only Kojis and charge a fee for their premium content, without additional template development or configuration.
To offer premium content, configure a subscription from your https://withkoji.com/creator[creator dashboard].
Then, when publishing a remix, set the *Subscriber only* option to designate the Koji as part of your subscription offering.
+

** The creator dashboard now shows consolidated analytics for all of your Kojis.
The overview includes standard, built-in metrics that are calculated from access logs as well as transaction and revenue data.
** You now have more options for customizing your Koji profile page.
** Transaction receipts on the Koji platform have been redesigned for enhanced usability.
* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package.
** You can now generate a signed URL for any objects stored on the Koji CDN, enabling Kojis to serve them without exposing a permanent URI.
This feature provides additional security protection against sharing or rehosting of private or subscription-only content.
To use a signed URL, use the new `generateSignedUrl` method.
** You can now hide the default action for advancing from a remix to a preview, enabling the template to handle validation and other processing first.
To hide the default action, enable the new `InstantRemixingNativeNavigation` entitlement.
To advance to a preview, use the new `finish` method.
* The developer site includes the following updates.
** New content is available to help Koji developers get the most value from their templates, including <<template-versions#>>, <<testing-templates#>>, and <<plugins#>>.
** The site design and navigation have been updated.

=== November 24

* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-koji-auth-sdk#>> package.
** Enable users to "sign in" to a Koji and create a custom user ID for it.
To request authorization for the user's ID, use the new `grants` parameter in the `getToken` and `getTokenWithCallback` methods.
The new `allowAnonymous` parameter enables users to proceed without logging in, when appropriate.
** Send push notifications with a user's ID, if the user has granted this authorization to the Koji.
To validate the user’s authorization grants and get the user's ID, use the new `checkGrant` and `getGrant` methods.
To send the notification, use the new `pushNotification` method.
* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-dispatch-package#>> package.
** Connect to dispatch from your backend service and use it to broadcast messages to connected clients.
To instantiate dispatch on the backend, use the new `projectToken` configuration option.
** Send secure messages to specific clients, rather than broadcasting every message to all clients.
The new `identify` method allows a client to use a short-lived `authToken` to identify itself to Koji dispatch.
Then, the server or other dispatch clients can send secure messages to that client by including an array of `recipients` when calling `emitEvent`.
* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package.
** Design an About page as a landing page for remixers of a Koji.
To provide an About page, enable the new `AboutContext` entitlement, and use the new `createRemix` method to trigger the remix from it.
+

** Use the new `?context=remix` URL parameter to determine when a Koji is being remixed.
* In the <<withkoji-database-package#>> package, you can now batch database updates into a single transaction, which can reduce latency when making multiple updates to different collections.
To batch database updates, set the new `mode` parameter to `transaction` when instantiating the database.
Then, use the new `beginTransaction` and `commitTransaction` methods to submit one or more update requests.
* The <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#>> package now includes `transactionIds` in a receipt object.
This information enables you to link to a transaction from a notification (for example, `\https://withkoji.com/payments/transactions/TXN_ID`).
* On the Koji platform, you can now manage plugins and custom domains directly from a Koji, without opening the code.
** To manage the plugins for a Koji you created, use the Koji button in the top right, and then go to *More > Manage this Koji > Plugins*.
Plugins are available to add common functionality, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel, to the frontend of a Koji.
** To manage the custom domains for a Koji you created, use the *Koji* button in the top right, and then go to *Settings > Custom domains*.
* On the Koji platform, your new https://withkoji.com/creator[creator dashboard] replaces your evolution dashboard.
* On the developer site, new resources are available to help Koji developers solve common problems, including <<frontend-uploading#>> and <<persist-session-data#>>.

=== November 13

* The new <<koji-vcc#, koji VCC>> enables remixers to create a new Koji or select an existing Koji, either from their profile or from a URL.
The VCC stores the URL as the value.
* In desktop view, the built-in <<vcc-overview#, Visual Customization Controls>> (VCCs) now appear as contextual menus, which open automatically in the position where the user clicks.
** To use this feature in your existing templates, install version 1.1.42 of the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package.
** To override the automatic positioning, set an absolute position with the `attributes` object when calling `onPresentControl`.
* The <<color#, color VCC>> now accepts the `allowAlpha` type option, which shows a transparency slider when enabled.
* The built-in VCCs have an updated look and feel.

* You can now track custom events in your Koji templates with the <<withkoji-koji-analytics-sdk#>> package.
* The `startPurchase` method in the <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#.startPurchase#, @withkoji/iap>> package has been updated.
The callback function now receives the receipt ID on successful purchases.
* The `showmodal` method has been removed from the @withkoji/custom-vcc-sdk package.

=== October 29

* The Koji platform now allows you to edit a Koji you created and republish it to the same URL.
** To provide different template experiences for editing an existing Koji and for creating a new remix, use the new `mode` editor attribute in the `onSetRemixing` method.
For example, you might want to clear the default values for a new remix but not for an edit.
For updated documentation, see the <<withkoji-vcc-package#.onSetRemixing, package reference>>.
** To edit a Koji you created, use the *Koji button* in the top right, and then go to *More > Manage this Koji > Edit this Koji*.
* The following features are now available in the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package.
** *Navigation methods* – The new `navigate` and `present` methods enable you to manage navigation without triggering browser events, for a smoother experience in embedded contexts.
** *Sticker context* – The new `?context=sticker` URL parameter enables you to embed another Koji in an iframe as a sticker.
The `StickerContext` entitlement enables you to define a distinct template experience when the template is embedded in another Koji.
** *Admin context* – The new `?context=admin` URL parameter and `AdminContext` entitlement enable you to design functionality that is intended for the creator of the Koji.
The creator can access this functionality by using the *Koji button* in the top right, and then going to *More > Manage this Koji > Admin dashboard*.
* Starting with version 1.1.40 of @withkoji/vcc package, developers using VccMiddleware must use `res.locals.KOJI_PROJECT_ID` and `res.locals.KOJI_PROJECT_TOKEN`, instead of `process.env.KOJI_PROJECT` and `process.env.KOJI_PROJECT_TOKEN`, when instantiating services such as database, auth, and in-app purchases.
* The new <<withkoji-koji-auth-sdk#>> package enables you to authenticate users in Koji templates.
Available features include:
** Determine whether the current user created the Koji so that you can tailor the experience accordingly.
** Send notifications to the Koji account of the user who created the Koji.
+
image::push-notifications-oct2020.png[Push notifications]
* The Koji platform now enables template developers to control the timing of the rich preview screenshot with the `window.kojiScreenshotReady` property.
This feature enables you to ensure that all relevant assets have loaded before the image is generated.
For updated documentation, see <<rich-preview-image#>>.
* On the developer site, updated content is available to help new Koji developers onboard more quickly, including <<instant-remixing#>> (new), <<templates#>> (updated), and <<introduction#>> (updated).

=== October 19

.Koji platform updates
* Templates now support simple content moderation and data collection by enabling a creator to view or download collected data and to quickly remove an offensive entry or a mistake.
+
image::database-views-oct2020.png[Manage content]
** To customize the data presentation for remixers, configure a <<koji-database#, database view>> when developing the template.
You can specify user-friendly collection and column names, define the data types for rich data display, exclude unnecessary columns, and control the column order and default sort.
** To access the data for a Koji you created, use the *Koji button* in the top right, and then go to *More > Manage this Koji > View database*.
* The new *Magic Link* enables you to register a custom `koji.to` link that points any Koji.
For example, you could point to a Koji "bio", and then share or post the link everywhere.
If you ever want to update your bio or use a different Koji, you can change the link target in one place.
+
image::magic-link-oct2020.png[Enable Magic Link]
** To set up your Magic Link, tap your profile picture, and then tap *Magic Link*.
Enable your Magic Link and enter your desired link address (for example, `\https://koji.to/myname`).
By default, the link points to your Koji profile page.
** To change the link target, open the desired Koji and tap the *Koji button* in the top right.
Then, go to *More > Manage this Koji > Use as Magic Link*.

Dynamic receipts enable you to display a route in a Koji from a transaction receipt.
For example, you can show a video response from a seller to a buyer.
The following enhancements support implementation of dynamic receipts in Koji templates:
** The `dynamicReceipt` entitlement enables the receipt for a product to display routes in the Koji.
** When a buyer or seller views the transaction receipt for an applicable product, the platform appends the `dynamic-receipt` query parameter to the URL.
For example, `dynamic-receipt=buyer` or `dynamic-receipt=seller`.
** The `resolveReceiptById` method retrieves a specific transaction receipt.
