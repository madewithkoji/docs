:page-description: Description of the unique files and elements in a Koji project that power the magic of customization.

Koji provides you with an environment for developing and publishing an application in your browser.
The project environment includes a terminal connected to a running container with all the familiar tools, the same code editor that powers VSCode, and tools to help you deploy and publish your application to https://withkoji.com[withkoji.com].

== Project directory

The project directory at `/usr/src/app` includes a Git repository for your project with two remotes.

. `origin`: The git remote from which projects are built and deployed.
. `upstream`: The git remote from which projects are forked (a repository on GitHub for example).

Run `git remote -v` to see the remotes in your project.

[source,bash]

== README

The `README.md` file is required at the top level your project directory.
This markdown file documents the tech stack and any relevant information to aid someone working with the code.

== .koji directory

The `.koji` directory is where your configuration and script files live, including project configuration for development and deploy and customizations for Visual Customization Controls (VCCs).

[source,console]

â”œâ”€â”€ customization

[IMPORTANT]
====
The only required files for Koji to work are:

* `README.md`: Displays project information in the project overview.
* `develop.json`: Lets the Koji editor know how your project development works (project path, port, start command, and events).
* `deploy.json`: Lets deploy know where your project build works (build path, port, build commands).
====

=== develop.json

`.koji/project/develop.json` contains development configuration for your project.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "develop": {
    "frontend": {
      "path": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "startCommand": "npm start"
    }
  }
}
----

In this file the important things to look at are:

* `path`: Indicates the directory for your frontend and backend.
* `port`:  Matches the port on which your development server is running.
* `startCommand` for your application is placed in the start script of your package.json (for npm start to work).

=== deploy.json

`.koji/project/deploy.json` contains deploy configuration for your project.

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "deploy":  {
    "frontend":  {
      "output":  "frontend/build",
      "commands":  [
        "cd frontend",
        "npm install",
        "export NODE_ENV=production && npm run compile"
      ],
    },
    "backend":  {
      "output":  "backend/dist",
      "type": "dynamic",
      "commands":  [
        "cd backend",
        "npm install",
        "export NODE_ENV=production && npm run compile"
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

In `deploy.json` make sure to check that:

* `output`: Indicates the directory where your files will be compiled after the `"commands"` list is done.

* `type`: Is either `static` if the service deploys a static bundle (HTML, CSS, JS), or `dynamic` if the service deploys a server.
* `commands`: Lists the steps to build your project.

The .json files in this directory each have a very specific schema that controls how the Koji editor deals with files.
develop.json deals with setting up your editor so you will have the best editing experience and deploy.json tells Koji how to turn your code into a live app.
These files have the following schema:

=== .koji/customization

The JSON files in this directory define the names, types, configuration options, and default values for VCCs used in the template.
Every file created in this directory is displayed in the VCC Explorer section in the left navigation pane.

The following file would be saved as `example.json` and displayed in the left pane as *Example*:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "example":  {
    "param":  "this is the value of the param"
  },
  "@@editor":  [
    {
      "key":  "example",
      "name":  "Example",
      "icon":  "ðŸ˜„",
      "source":  "example.json",
      "fields":  [
        {
          "key":  "param",
          "name":  "An Example Parameter",
          "type":  "text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

If you are using the <<withkoji-vcc-package#>> package, you can access this property with `instantRemixing.get(['example', 'param'])`.
