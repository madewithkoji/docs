:page-description: How to add a backend service to a Koji template.
:includespath: ../_includes

As you develop and extend apps on Koji, you will likely encounter situations where it would be useful to put some of your code into a service.
In general, a service is a software component that provides functionality to clients.
It's usually set up to be accessible via public or internal ports.
The client software can then access the functionality provided by the service by using HTTP calls.

In this tutorial, you will add a backend service to an existing app and confirm that it's working.

[NOTE]
In Koji apps, the frontend also runs as a service. This allows your apps to be run inside other applications and even inside other Koji apps.

*Time*: 30 minutes

== Prerequisites

include::{includespath}/prereqs.adoc[tags=webdev;remixproc]

== Setting up the template

To add and test a backend service, you'll start by forking an app that already has a frontend.

. Open the following scaffold.
+
include::{includespath}/starterScaffolds.adoc[tag=react]
. Click *Fork*.
The *Project Details* page opens.
. Click *Open in Code Editor*.
The app opens in the Koji editor.

== Adding the backend project

The backend will be an npm project, just like the frontend.
You will use these files to get started:

* `package.json` – Defines the packages and commands.
* `.babelrc` – Helps with the transpiling.
* `server.js` – Runs a simple express server that the frontend will be able to call.

You will configure these files and install the required packages for the backend service.

. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to the `frontend` folder in the source code, click *New File*, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,text]
/backend/package.json
+
This path creates a `backend` folder and a `package.json` file.
. Paste the following code into `package.json`, and then save the file.
+
[source,json]

. To open a new terminal, click *New tab* at the bottom of the editor.
+
You should see a new command line interface, open to `/usr/src/app`.
. Go to the `backend` folder.
+
[source,bash]
cd backend
. Install the packages.
+
[source,bash]
npm install
+
You should see the installation progress messages.
After installation is complete, you should be returned to the command line.
The required packages are now installed.

These Babel configurations add syntax that will help your project build and compile correctly.
. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to any folder in the source code, click *New File*, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,shell]
----
/backend/server.js
----
+
This path creates a `server.js` file in the `backend` folder.
You will use this file to run the backend server.
. Paste the following code into `server.js`, and then save the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import '@babel/core';
import express from 'express';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cors from 'cors';
import { KojiBackend } from '@withkoji/core';

// Create server
const app = express();

// Specifically enable CORS for pre-flight options requests
app.options('*', cors())

// Enable body parsers for reading POST data. We set up this app to
// accept JSON bodies and x-www-form-urlencoded bodies. If you wanted to
// process other request types, like form-data or graphql, you would need
// to include the appropriate parser middlewares here.
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  limit: '2mb',
  extended: true,
}));

// CORS allows these API routes to be requested directly by browsers
app.use(cors());

// Disable caching
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Cache-Control', 'private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
  res.header('Expires', '-1');
  res.header('Pragma', 'no-cache');
  next();
});

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        text: 'Hello, world!',
    });
});

// Start server
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3333, null, async err => {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
    console.log('[koji] backend started');
});
----
+
This code will start a basic express server, which will respond to a GET with JSON that you can verify on the frontend.

== Accessing internal Koji variables

There are several values your app will need to get from Koji.

* The URL for the frontend.
* The URL for the backend.
* The project ID

Koji stores these values in internal variables. To make them accessible to your app, you need to map them to environment variables, and then add them to the configuration.

. Open the frontend/.env file, update the contents as follows, and then save the file.
+
[source,text]
----
REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=$KOJI_SERVICE_URL_frontend
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=$KOJI_SERVICE_URL_backend
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=$KOJI_PROJECT_ID
----
. Open the frontend/src/index.js file, update the config call as follows, and then save the file.
+
[source,javascript]
----
....
Koji.config(kojiConfig, {
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID,
  services: {
    backend: process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL,
    frontend: process.env.REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL
  },
});
....
----

== Letting Koji know about the backend service

You have now added a backend project, but the Koji editor and app builder still don't know it exists.
You must update the `koji.json` file to let Koji know about the new service.
`koji.json` is located in the root directory.

. Open the `koji.json` file, and replace the existing content with the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "deploy": {
    "frontend": {
      "output": "frontend/build",
      "type": "static",
      "commands": [
        "cd frontend",
        "npm install",
        "export NODE_ENV=production && npm run build"
      ]
    },
    "backend": {
      "output": "backend",
      "type": "dynamic",
      "commands": [
        "cd backend",
        "npm install",
        "export NODE_ENV=production && npm run compile"
      ]
    }
  },
  "develop": {
    "frontend": {
      "path": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "startCommand": "npm start"
    },
    "backend": {
      "path": "backend",
      "port": 3333,
      "startCommand": "npm run start-dev"
    }
  },
  "entitlements": {
    "InstantRemixing": true,
    "InstantRemixingNativeNavigation": true,
    "FeedEvents": true
  },
  "remixData": {
    "backgroundColor": "#282c34"
  },
  "@@initialTransform": {
    "remixData": {}
  }
}
----
+
This file lets the Koji editor know which services to run, so you must add entries for the `backend` service.
. On the left side of the editor, go to *Advanced > Remote environment* and click *Force restart project*.
+
If everything went well, you should be able to reconnect to the editor and see that a `backend` terminal has been added at the bottom.
+
If you see `[koji] backend started`, your backend service is now running in your local editor environment.

== Testing the backend service

To test that everything is working correctly, you can modify your frontend code to get a value from the backend service and display it automatically.

. Go to the `frontend` folder, press CTL-C to stop the frontend server, and install the `styled-components` package, which the new code will use.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install styled-components
----
. Restart the frontend server.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run start-dev
----
. Open the `/frontend/src/App.js` file and replace the contents with the following code.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';
import Koji from '@withkoji/core';

const Container = styled.div`
    background-color: #395B88;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
    color: #FCFCFC;
    text-align: center;
`;

const AppLogoSpin = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

const Icon = styled.div`
    animation: ${AppLogoSpin} infinite 20s linear;
    height: 50vmin;
    width: 50vmin;
    pointer-events: none;
    background-image: url("https://images.koji-cdn.com/d9c6b38e-08c4-4faf-ae8e-01082c41a0fb/3f83q-9634d620e97345a6b250ca2feb7e5a2e.png");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
`;

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
        text: 'Updating in 5 seconds...',
        title: '',
       };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      window.setTimeout(() => {
        fetch(Koji.services.backend)
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((jsonResponse) => {
            console.log('jsonResponse', jsonResponse);
            this.setState({ text: jsonResponse.text });
          });
      }, 5000);
    }

  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <h1>{this.state.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.state.text}</p>
        <Icon />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
----
+
This code sets a default text state of `Updating in 5 seconds`.
After the component mounts, it sets a timeout of 5 seconds, and then tries to fetch your backend route and set the response as the new text state.
. Open the live preview and refresh it.
+
If everything worked, you should see the first text state for 5 seconds, and then it should be replaced with the `Hello, world!` text from the server.
. Publish your template and confirm that it's working as expected.

[TIP]
====
If you're wondering how these services work behind the scenes, here's a brief explanation:

. The `develop` and `deploy` sections in `koji.json` contain service keys, such as `frontend`.
. For each of these keys, the container that handles your editor or published deployment will automatically generate a URL.
. That URL is saved as a variable inside Koji, which is based on the key.
The variable name is `$KOJI_SERVICE_URL_backend`.
. In `frontend/.env`, you defined an environment variable that points to this internal Koji variable, so that your app is able to retrieve the value.
====

== Wrapping up

Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a better understanding of how to add a service.

TIP: When adding backend services to your templates, keep in mind that requests to Koji backends are rate limited to protect against bursts of traffic.
Users who send too many requests in quick succession might see error messages with a status code of `429`.
To gracefully handle rate limiting in your templates, you can watch for this status code and build in a retry mechanism.
