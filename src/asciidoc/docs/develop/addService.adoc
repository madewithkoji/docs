:page-description: How to add a backend service to a Koji template.

As you develop and extend templates on Koji, you will likely run into issues where your `serviceMap` doesn't look the way you think it should.
Or, you have remixed a project with a frontend, but you need to add a backend.

In this tutorial, you will add a backend service to an existing project, and confirm that it is available in the `serviceMap`.

*Time*: 30 minutes

== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with the Koji editor, remix process, and the @withkoji/vcc package is required.
* Familiarity with React and ES6 basics are a plus.

== Setting up the template

To add and test a backend service, you'll start by remixing a project that already has a frontend.

. Open the following scaffold.
+
include::../_includes/starterScaffolds.adoc[tag=reactVccs]
. {blank}
include::../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
. After your editor has loaded, rename the project.
For example, `Adding a Backend Project`.

== Watching for serviceMap changes

You will want to monitor the value of `serviceMap`.
When you can see the `backend` service, you'll know that the service is set up correctly.

. Open `frontend/common/App.js`, which is the main client file.
. In the `App` component, add the following line above the `return` call.
+
[source,javascript]
console.log('serviceMap', instantRemixing.get(['serviceMap']));

. In the Preview pane on the right, click the *Remote* tab, and then click *Open in new tab*.
. In the new tab, open the developer tools and confirm that you can see a console log of your current `serviceMap`.
+
It should look like this:
+
[source,console]
serviceMap: {frontend: "https://8080-334797ce-40e0-4c76-af94-79fba39fff89.koji-staging.com"}
+
Right now, you should see only a `frontend` service. Next, you will add a `backend`.

== Adding the backend project

The backend will be an npm project, just like the frontend.
You will use these files to get started:

* `package.json` – Defines the packages and commands.
* `.babelrc` – Helps with the transpiling.
* `server.js` – Runs a simple express server that the frontend will be able to call.

You will configure these files and install the required packages for the backend service.

. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to any folder in the source code, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,text]
/backend/package.json
+
This path creates a `backend` folder and a `package.json` file.
. Open the `package.json` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,json]

    "babel-preset-stage-0": "6.24.1",
    "babel-watch": "git+https://github.com/kmagiera/babel-watch.git"
  }
}
----
. To open a new terminal, click *New tab* at the bottom of the editor.
+
You should see a new command line interface, open to `/usr/src/app`.
. Go to the `backend` folder.
+
[source,bash]
cd backend
. Install the packages.
+
[source,bash]
npm install
+
You should see the installation progress messages. After installation is complete, you should be returned to the command line.
The required packages are now installed.
. To close the terminal, run the following command.
+
[source,bash]
exit

. To collapse the terminal pane, click the down arrow in the upper right.
. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to the `backend` folder in the source code, and then enter the following path.
+
[source, text]
----
/backend/.babelrc
----
+
This path creates a `.babelrc` file in the `backend` folder.
. Open the `.babelrc` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/babelrc.json[]
----
+
These Babel configurations add syntax that will help your project build and compile correctly.
. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to the `backend` folder in the source code, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,shell]
----
/backend/server.js
----
+
This path creates a `server.js` file in the `backend` folder.
You will use this file to run the backend server.
. Open the `server.js` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import 'babel-polyfill';
import express from 'express';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cors from 'cors';

// Create server
const app = express();

// Specifically enable CORS for pre-flight options requests
app.options('*', cors())

// Enable body parsers for reading POST data. We set up this app to
// accept JSON bodies and x-www-form-urlencoded bodies. If you wanted to
// process other request types, like form-data or graphql, you would need
// to include the appropriate parser middlewares here.
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  limit: '2mb',
  extended: true,
}));

// CORS allows these API routes to be requested directly by browsers
app.use(cors());

// Disable caching
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Cache-Control', 'private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
  res.header('Expires', '-1');
  res.header('Pragma', 'no-cache');
  next();
});

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        text: 'Hello, world!',
    });
});

// Start server
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3333, null, async err => {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
    console.log('[koji] backend started');
});
----
+
This code will start a basic express server, which will respond to a GET with JSON that you can verify on the frontend.

== Letting Koji know about the backend service

You have now added a backend project, but the Koji editor and project builder still don't know it exists.
You must update the `develop.json` and `deploy.json` files to let Koji know about the new service.
Both files are located in the `.koji` folder of the project folder.

. Open the `.koji/project/develop.json` file and update it to look like the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/develop.json[tags=**,indent=0]
----
+
This file lets the Koji editor know which services to run, so you must add an entry for the `backend` service.
. On the left side of the editor, go to *Advanced > Remote environment* and click *Force restart project*.
+
If everything went well, you should be able to reconnect to the editor and see that a `backend` terminal has been added at the bottom.
+
If you see `[koji] backend started`, your backend service is now running in your local editor environment.
. To confirm that the `serviceMap` is now populated, open your preview tab and refresh it. You should now see a console log that looks like this example.
+
[source,console]
----
serviceMap: {
  frontend: "https://8080-984c0a6f-3614-4dee-89f0-7d7cc03df6e9.koji-staging.com",
  backend: "https://3333-984c0a6f-3614-4dee-89f0-7d7cc03df6e9.koji-staging.com"}
----
. Open the `.koji/project/deploy.json` file and update it to look like the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/deploy.json[tags=**,indent=0]
----
+
This code adds the backend service to the build process.
As you can see, the `deploy.json` code looks very similar to the `develop.json` file, except that it runs build commands instead of development commands.

== Testing the serviceMap and server

To test that everything is working correctly, update your frontend code to get a value from the server and display it automatically.

. Open the `/frontend/common/App.js` file and replace it with the following code.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';
import { InstantRemixing } from '@withkoji/vcc';

const Container = styled.div`
    background-color: #395B88;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
    color: #FCFCFC;
    text-align: center;
`;

const AppLogoSpin = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

const Icon = styled.div`
    animation: ${AppLogoSpin} infinite 20s linear;
    height: 50vmin;
    width: 50vmin;
    pointer-events: none;
    background-image: url("https://images.koji-cdn.com/d9c6b38e-08c4-4faf-ae8e-01082c41a0fb/3f83q-9634d620e97345a6b250ca2feb7e5a2e.png");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
`;

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
        text: 'Updating in 5 seconds...',
        title: '',
       };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

      window.setTimeout(() => {
        fetch(this.instantRemixing.get(['serviceMap', 'backend']))
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((jsonResponse) => {
            console.log('jsonResponse', jsonResponse);
            this.setState({ text: jsonResponse.text });
          });
        }, 5000);
    }

  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <h1>{this.state.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.state.text}</p>
        <Icon />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
----
+
This code sets a default text state of `Updating in 5 seconds`.
After the component mounts, it sets a timeout of 5 seconds, and then tries to fetch your backend route and set the response as the new text state.
. Open the live preview and refresh it.
+
If everything worked, you should see the first text state for 5 seconds, and then it should be replaced with the `Hello, world!` text from the server.
. Publish your template and confirm that it working as expected.

[TIP]
====
If you're wondering about how these services work behind the scenes, here is a brief explanation:

. The `develop.json` or `deploy.json` files in `.koji/project` contain service keys, such as `frontend`.
. For each of these keys, the container that handles your editor or published deployment will automatically generate a URL.
. That URL is written as an environment variable, which based on the key.
So, for `frontend`, you will see an ENV like `KOJI_SERVICE_URL_FRONTEND`.
. For each of the ENV variables that match that pattern, the @withkoij/vcc package exposes the values in the serviceMap.

== Wrapping up

Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a better understanding of how to add a service, as well as the service map configuration.
