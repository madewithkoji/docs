:page-description: How to add a backend service to a Koji template.
:includespath: ../_includes

As you develop and extend templates on Koji, you will likely run into issues where your `serviceMap` doesn't look the way you think it should.
Or, you have remixed a project with a frontend, but you need to add a backend.

In this tutorial, you will add a backend service to an existing project, and confirm that it is available in the `serviceMap`.

*Time*: 30 minutes

== Prerequisites

include::{includespath}/prereqs.adoc[tags=webdev;remixproc;customvcc]

== Setting up the template

To add and test a backend service, you'll start by remixing a project that already has a frontend.

. Open the following scaffold.
+
include::../_includes/starterScaffolds.adoc[tag=reactVccs]
. {blank}
include::../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
. After your editor has loaded, rename the project.
For example, `Adding a Backend Project`.

== Watching for serviceMap changes

You will want to monitor the value of `serviceMap`.
When you can see the `backend` service, you'll know that the service is set up correctly.

. Open `frontend/common/App.js`, which is the main client file.
. In the `App` component, add the following line above the `return` call.
+
[source,javascript]
console.log('serviceMap', instantRemixing.get(['serviceMap']));

. In the preview pane on the right, click the remote staging button image:remote-staging.png[Remote staging button] to open your template in a new browser tab.
. In the new tab, open the developer tools and confirm that you can see a console log of your current `serviceMap`.
+
It should look like this:
+
[source,console]
serviceMap: {frontend: "https://8080-334797ce-40e0-4c76-af94-79fba39fff89.koji-staging.com"}
+
Right now, you should see only a `frontend` service. Next, you will add a `backend`.

== Adding the backend project

The backend will be an npm project, just like the frontend.
You will use these files to get started:

* `package.json` – Defines the packages and commands.
* `.babelrc` – Helps with the transpiling.
* `server.js` – Runs a simple express server that the frontend will be able to call.

You will configure these files and install the required packages for the backend service.

. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to any folder in the source code, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,text]
/backend/package.json
+
This path creates a `backend` folder and a `package.json` file.
. Open the `package.json` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,json]

  }
}
----
. To open a new terminal, click *New tab* at the bottom of the editor.
+
You should see a new command line interface, open to `/usr/src/app`.
. Go to the `backend` folder.
+
[source,bash]
cd backend
. Install the packages.
+
[source,bash]
npm install
+
You should see the installation progress messages. After installation is complete, you should be returned to the command line.
The required packages are now installed.
. To close the terminal, run the following command.
+
[source,bash]
exit

. To collapse the terminal pane, click the down arrow in the upper right.
. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to the `backend` folder in the source code, and then enter the following path.
+
[source, text]
----
/backend/.babelrc
----
+
This path creates a `.babelrc` file in the `backend` folder.
. Open the `.babelrc` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/babelrc.json[]
----
+
These Babel configurations add syntax that will help your project build and compile correctly.
. On the left side of the editor, click the plus (*+*) next to the `backend` folder in the source code, and then enter the following path:
+
[source,shell]
----
/backend/server.js
----
+
This path creates a `server.js` file in the `backend` folder.
You will use this file to run the backend server.
. Open the `server.js` file, and then paste and save the following code.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import 'babel-polyfill';
import express from 'express';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cors from 'cors';

// Create server
const app = express();

// Specifically enable CORS for pre-flight options requests
app.options('*', cors())

// Enable body parsers for reading POST data. We set up this app to
// accept JSON bodies and x-www-form-urlencoded bodies. If you wanted to
// process other request types, like form-data or graphql, you would need
// to include the appropriate parser middlewares here.
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  limit: '2mb',
  extended: true,
}));

// CORS allows these API routes to be requested directly by browsers
app.use(cors());

// Disable caching
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Cache-Control', 'private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
  res.header('Expires', '-1');
  res.header('Pragma', 'no-cache');
  next();
});

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        text: 'Hello, world!',
    });
});

// Start server
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3333, null, async err => {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
    console.log('[koji] backend started');
});
----
+
This code will start a basic express server, which will respond to a GET with JSON that you can verify on the frontend.

== Letting Koji know about the backend service

You have now added a backend project, but the Koji editor and project builder still don't know it exists.
You must update the `develop.json` and `deploy.json` files to let Koji know about the new service.
Both files are located in the `.koji` folder of the project folder.

. Open the `.koji/project/develop.json` file and update it to look like the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/develop.json[tags=**,indent=0]
----
+
This file lets the Koji editor know which services to run, so you must add an entry for the `backend` service.
. On the left side of the editor, go to *Advanced > Remote environment* and click *Force restart project*.
+
If everything went well, you should be able to reconnect to the editor and see that a `backend` terminal has been added at the bottom.
+
If you see `[koji] backend started`, your backend service is now running in your local editor environment.
. To confirm that the `serviceMap` is now populated, open your preview tab and refresh it. You should now see a console log that looks like this example.
+
[source,console]
----
serviceMap: {
  frontend: "https://8080-984c0a6f-3614-4dee-89f0-7d7cc03df6e9.koji-staging.com",
  backend: "https://3333-984c0a6f-3614-4dee-89f0-7d7cc03df6e9.koji-staging.com"}
----
. Open the `.koji/project/deploy.json` file and update it to look like the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
include::../_includes/deploy.json[tags=**,indent=0]
----
+
This code adds the backend service to the build process.
As you can see, the `deploy.json` code looks very similar to the `develop.json` file, except that it runs build commands instead of development commands.

== Testing the serviceMap and server

To test that everything is working correctly, update your frontend code to get a value from the server and display it automatically.

. Open the `/frontend/common/App.js` file and replace it with the following code.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';
import { InstantRemixing } from '@withkoji/vcc';

const Container = styled.div`
    background-color: #395B88;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
    color: #FCFCFC;
    text-align: center;
`;

const AppLogoSpin = keyframes`
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
`;

const Icon = styled.div`
    animation: ${AppLogoSpin} infinite 20s linear;
    height: 50vmin;
    width: 50vmin;
    pointer-events: none;
    background-image: url("https://images.koji-cdn.com/d9c6b38e-08c4-4faf-ae8e-01082c41a0fb/3f83q-9634d620e97345a6b250ca2feb7e5a2e.png");
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
`;

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.state = {
        text: 'Updating in 5 seconds...',
        title: '',
       };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

      window.setTimeout(() => {
        fetch(this.instantRemixing.get(['serviceMap', 'backend']))
          .then((response) => response.json())
          .then((jsonResponse) => {
            console.log('jsonResponse', jsonResponse);
            this.setState({ text: jsonResponse.text });
          });
        }, 5000);
    }

  render() {
    return (
      <Container>
        <h1>{this.state.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.state.text}</p>
        <Icon />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
----
+
This code sets a default text state of `Updating in 5 seconds`.
After the component mounts, it sets a timeout of 5 seconds, and then tries to fetch your backend route and set the response as the new text state.
. Open the live preview and refresh it.
+
If everything worked, you should see the first text state for 5 seconds, and then it should be replaced with the `Hello, world!` text from the server.
. Publish your template and confirm that it working as expected.

[TIP]
====
If you're wondering about how these services work behind the scenes, here is a brief explanation:

. The `develop.json` or `deploy.json` files in `.koji/project` contain service keys, such as `frontend`.
. For each of these keys, the container that handles your editor or published deployment will automatically generate a URL.
. That URL is written as an environment variable, which based on the key.
So, for `frontend`, you will see an ENV like `KOJI_SERVICE_URL_FRONTEND`.
. For each of the ENV variables that match that pattern, the @withkoij/vcc package exposes the values in the serviceMap.
====

== Wrapping up

Hopefully, this tutorial has given you a better understanding of how to add a service, as well as the service map configuration.

TIP: When adding backend services to your templates, keep in mind that requests to Koji backends are rate limited to protect against bursts of traffic.
Users who send too many requests in quick succession might see error messages with a status code of `429`.
To gracefully handle rate limiting in your templates, you can watch for this status code and build in a retry mechanism.
