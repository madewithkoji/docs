There are various methods you can use to test your Koji templates.

== Publish unlisted

When you publish your template, you can select the *Unlisted* option.
This will prevent anyone else from seeing the published template.

Click *Publish form* to display the following form:

Click *Show advanced options* near the bottom left of the form.
This will display two checkboxes.
Select *Unlisted*.
Click *Publish* and follow the directions to publish your template. (See <<publish-locally-developed#,Publishing a project you developed locally>>.)

Now you can test the template under exactly the same conditions as a general user, but no general users will have access to it.
When you are ready to give general users access, just unselect *Unlisted* and republish the template.
