:page-description: A consolidated resource for methods a developer can use to test templates

There are various ways you can test your Koji templates.
Some of the most common methods are listed below.

== Publish unlisted

When you publish your template, you can select the *Unlisted* option.
This will prevent anyone else from seeing the published template.

Click *Publish form* to display the following form:

Click *Show advanced options* near the bottom left of the form.
This will display two checkboxes.
Select *Unlisted*.
Click *Publish* and follow the directions to publish your template.
(See <<publish-locally-developed#,Publishing a project you developed locally>>.)

Now you can test the template under exactly the same conditions as a general user, but no general users will have access to it.
When you are ready to give general users access, just unselect *Unlisted* and republish the template.

== Testing in editor mode

If you're using the Koji Editor to develop your template, there are many options for previewing its behavior.
These are covered in detail in the documentation for the Editor (see <<editor#>>).

The *Live preview* tab allows you to toggle between *Preview* mode, which shows what the Koji looks like running, and *Editing* mode, which shows what remixers see when customizing values.
*Editing* mode even allows you to perform remixing in the preview.

The *Remote* tab offers several additional ways of previewing your Koji.
You can test it on your mobile device by scanning a QR code.
There are also options for opening the Koji in a new tab, running it in a live player, or copying the link for the preview.
If you share this link with someone else, they can preview the Koji while it's still in development.

[NOTE]
The remote preview link will only work for as long as your editor session is still active, so it is not suitable for long-term sharing.

The *Routes* tab lets you test your backend routes.
It's similar to using a program like curl or Fiddler.
For instance, you can manually enter an HTTP request, configure a header for it, send the request, and examine the results returned by the server.

== Viewing messages passed between the Koji and player bridges

The *Live preview* pane includes one other tab that displays a thumbnail for the Koji.
Below the thumbnail are a number of buttons.
Clicking the last button on the right opens a pane to the right of the thumbnail which displays the messages that the Koji and player bridges pass back and forth.
These messages are updated in real time.

== Testing feed autoplay

If you have videos or audio files in your Koji that play automatically, you may want them to play only when they are visible to the user.
For instance, if the user scrolls past a video, it should start playing when it first scrolls into view and stop playing when it scrolls offscreen.
To test the autoplay feature, you can open a published template and append `?feedDebug=true` to the URL.
The template is loaded in the feed 10 times and you can swipe or scroll through to ensure the animation starts and stops as expected.
If you haven't published the template yet, you can perform the same test by using *Debug in live player* in the *Remote* tab.
This opens a preview in a new browser tab.

[NOTE]
`Open in new tab` will not work.
This takes you to a staging area, where this feature is not available.
