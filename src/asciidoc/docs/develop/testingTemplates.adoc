:page-description: A consolidated resource for methods a developer can use to test templates

There are various methods you can use to test your Koji templates.

== Publish unlisted

When you publish your template, you can select the *Unlisted* option.
This will prevent anyone else from seeing the published template.

Click *Publish form* to display the following form:

Click *Show advanced options* near the bottom left of the form.
This will display two checkboxes.
Select *Unlisted*.
Click *Publish* and follow the directions to publish your template. (See <<publish-locally-developed#,Publishing a project you developed locally>>.)

Now you can test the template under exactly the same conditions as a general user, but no general users will have access to it.
When you are ready to give general users access, just unselect *Unlisted* and republish the template.

== Testing in editor mode

If you're using the Koji Editor to develop your template, there are many options for previewing its behavior.
These are covered in detail in the documentation for the Editor (see <<editor#>>).

The *Live preview* tab allows you to toggle between *Preview* mode, which shows what the Koji looks like running, and *Editing* mode, which shows what remixers see when customizing values.
*Editing* mode even allows you to perform remixing in the preview.

The *Remote* tab offers several additional ways of previewing your Koji.
You can test it on your smartphone or other mobile device by scanning the QR code.
There are also options for opening the Koji in a new tab, running it in a live player, or copying the link for the preview.
If you share this link with someone else, they can preview the Koji while it's still in development.

[NOTE]
The remote preview link will only work for as long as your editor session is still active, so it is not suitable for long-term sharing.

The *Routes* tab is used for testing backend routes.
You can build your request and then click *Send Request* to execute it.
The *Fetch* tab generates a code snippet for the current request that you can easily add to your application's frontend.
