:page-description: Guide to testing Koji templates.

The Koji platform provides a variety tools for testing templates.
Many tests can be run inside the editor, so you don't have to go back and forth between the editor and a separate tab or window.
For example, you can remix, test backend routes, and preview what your template will look like on social media without ever leaving the editor.

Typically, you begin testing in the Koji editor.
Later, you'll want to publish the template as *Unlisted*, so you can test it in a production environment before giving access to general users.

== Testing in the Koji editor

An important feature of the Koji editor is the ability it gives you to preview a template's behavior.
*Live preview* allows you to preview a template in a pane inside the editor, while the *Remote* tab provides several options for previewing a template remotely.

=== Live preview

The *Live preview* tab allows you to toggle between *Preview* mode, which shows what the template looks like when running, and *Editing* mode, which allows you to perform remixing in the preview.

You can display different template experiences depending on the context in which the template is running.
*Live preview* allows you to preview those experiences.
For more on contexts, see <<withkoji-vcc-package#_context>>.

The editor provides built-in previews for standard contexts in the *Live preview* pane.
Some standard contexts, such as *Admin*, *About*, and *Sticker*, only appear if you enable them.

A few standard contexts only appear if you implement the feature that uses them and then enable them in that feature.
For example, *Buyer receipt* and *Seller receipt* only appear in *Live preview* if you implement <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#_iap,in-app purchases>>, enable <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#_iap,dynamic receipts>>, and then enable *Buyer receipt* and *Seller receipt*.

If you define a custom context in your application code, you can preview it in the *Live player* by appending the parameter to the URL.For example, `?context=custom`.
You cannot preview a custom context in the *Live preview*.

=== Remote previews

The *Remote* tab offers several additional ways of previewing your template.

* On a mobile device – Open a preview on any device by scanning a QR code.
Logs from the device appear in a pane in the editor.

* In a new tab – Open a preview on a staging server.
Logs from the tab appear in a pane in the editor.

* In the *Live player* – Open another browser window where the template is displayed in an iframe, just as the published template will display.
You can also use the *Live player* to <<_testing_in_app_purchases,test in-app purchases>>.
Logs from the browser window appear in a pane in the editor.

* With a shared link – Copy the link for the preview.
If you share this link with someone else, they can preview the template while it's still in development.
+
[NOTE]
The remote preview link will only work for as long as your editor session is still active, so it is not suitable for long-term sharing.

=== Testing backend routes

The *Routes* tab lets you test your backend routes.
It's similar to using a program like curl or Fiddler.
For example, you can manually enter an HTTP request, configure a header for it, send the request, and examine the results returned by the server.

=== Writing to the console

You can test JavaScript code by using the `console.log` method, which prints to the console.
To see the console in the Koji editor, click the console button image:consoleButton.jpg[Console button] in the *Live preview* pane.

For example, the following code snippet prints *Key pressed* to the console every time you press a key, as long as the *Live preview* pane is selected.

[NOTE]
You can select *Live preview* by clicking anywhere in its pane.

[source,javascript]
----
    $(window).keydown(function (e) {
        KEY_STATUS.keyDown = true;
        if (KEY_CODES[e.keyCode]) {
            e.preventDefault();
            KEY_STATUS[KEY_CODES[e.keyCode]] = true;
        }
        console.log("Key pressed");
    }).keyup(function (e) {
        KEY_STATUS.keyDown = false;
        if (KEY_CODES[e.keyCode]) {
            e.preventDefault();
            KEY_STATUS[KEY_CODES[e.keyCode]] = false;
        }
    });
----

When running your template outside the editor, you can access the console through the browser's menu.
See <<_using_browser_tools_for_testing>>.

=== Testing in-app purchases

If your template supports <<withkoji-koji-iap-package#,in-app purchases>>, you can test the functionality by clicking *Debug in live player* on the *Remote* tab.

. Log into your Koji account and click your profile icon to open the main menu.
. Click *Wallet*.
. If your *Wallet* is empty, top it up.
. In another browser window, open the Koji editor.
. Open the *Remote* tab and click *Debug in live player*.
. Try paying yourself a small amount.
. Go back to your *Wallet* to check that the transaction was successful.
+
If all went well, you'll see the amount you paid deducted from your balance.
The transaction will be marked *pending*.
. You should be able to refund the transaction, resetting your balance to its original value and cancelling the transaction fee.
+
[NOTE]
If *KojiPay* doesn't allow you to refund the transaction, it might not be finished processing the payment.
Wait a minute or two and try again.

=== Testing a social media share

When a user shares a remix of your template on social media, the Koji platform renders a rich preview (Open Graph) image based on a screenshot of the template.
You can preview this image by opening the *Thumbnail* tab in the *Live preview* pane.
For information about how to customize the image, see <<rich-preview-image#>>.

=== Viewing messages passed between a template and platform APIs

Platform features like VCCs and in-app purchases require communication between your template and platform APIs.
To support that communication, your template is loaded into a "player" iframe inside the browser.
The player allows messages to be sent from your template to the parent window and vice versa by using the `window.postMessage` API.
To view these messages, click the view messages button image:messagesButton.jpg[View messages] in the *Live preview* pane.

=== Testing feed autoplay

If you have video or audio files in your template that play automatically, you might want them to play only when they are visible to the user.
For example, if the user scrolls past a video, it should start playing when it first scrolls into view and stop playing when it scrolls off screen.

To test the autoplay feature, click *Debug in live player* to open the template in a new tab.
Append `?feedDebug=true` to the URL.
The template is loaded in the feed 10 times and you can swipe or scroll through to ensure the animation starts and stops as expected.

[NOTE]
You cannot use *Open in new tab* to test autoplay in the feed.
The tab opens in a staging area, where the feature is not available.

=== Using the database explorer

If your project uses the <<koji-database#,Koji database>>, you can test transactions by using the database explorer.

In the editor, select *Advanced > Database*.
A list of your collections opens.
Click a collection in the list to display its contents.

You can now use *Live preview > Default* to test your database setup.
Perform an action in the preview that should write a record to the selected collection, then click *Refresh* in the *Database* tab.
If the record insertion worked, you should see the new record displayed.

[NOTE]
It may take a few seconds for the database to be updated.
If the new record does not appear in the collection, try refreshing again.

You can delete a record from the collection by clicking the trashcan icon at the end of the row.
The preview will not be updated automatically.
You can force it to refresh by clicking the *Remix* tab and then clicking back on the *Default* tab.

This testing method works equally well when previewing the template in a new tab or on a mobile device.
In this case, you must refresh the browser to update the template after deleting a record.

== Using browser tools for testing

All modern browsers provide tools for debugging websites.
For example, in Google Chrome, you can open the debugging tools by clicking *More tools > Developer tools* or by pressing the F12 key.

== Testing your template in the production environment

If you publish your template as *Unlisted*, you can test it under exactly the same conditions as a general user, but no one else will have access unless you send them the direct link.

. Click *Publish now*.
. Review the name and description, and update them if desired.
. Click *Show advanced options*.
. Select *Unlisted*.
. Click *Publish*.
. When publishing is completed, click the link to view and test your updated template.
. When you're ready to give general users access, clear *Unlisted* and republish the template.
