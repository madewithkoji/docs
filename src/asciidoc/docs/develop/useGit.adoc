:page-description: How to use Git to clone a Koji project template to your development machine, so that you can work on it locally.

Although Koji provides a feature-rich online project editor, you might prefer to use your own suite of development tools in some cases.
This tutorial describes how to use Git to clone a Koji project template to your development machine, so that you can work on it locally.

This is the first part in a three-part tutorial.

. *Using Git to manage your project* (this tutorial)
. <<work-locally#>>
. <<publish-locally-developed#>>

== Prerequisites

To develop your Koji project locally, you need these tools:

. The open-source *Git* version control system.
+
Koji stores each template and each remixed project as a separate Git repository.
To work on a project locally, you will use Git to download a clone of your project to your local machine.
You can then make changes and use Git to push the changes back to the origin repository on the Koji servers.
+
This tutorial assumes that you already have https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed on your computer, and that you are familiar with the basic Git commands.
If you need to install Git on your computer, follow the instructions in the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git documentation].
. The open-source *Node.js* server environment.
+
Koji uses Node.js and many add-on packages to deliver your web application to your users' browsers.
You will need to https://nodejs.org/en/download/[install Node.js] and its associated Node Package Manager (NPM) to run a Node server on your development computer.
. A *terminal* application.
+
You will be typing commands that use git and npm to set up your development environment.
Depending on your operating system, the application you use will be different.
Here are some suggestions:
+
* https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line[Terminal] on macOS
* https://msysgit.github.io/[GitBash] on Windows
* https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/[Linux Terminal] on Linux
. A *text editor*.
+
You will use a text editor to edit your code, and save it as plain-text files.
A text editor that is designed for writing code can help you in many ways, such as verifying structure and syntax or finding the correct variables or function names.
For more information, see this https://kinsta.com/blog/best-text-editors/[list of recommended text editors], which includes several that are excellent and free.

== Choosing a template for your project

This tutorial uses the *Element Match* template as an example because it illustrates a completed game with code that runs both on the backend and on the frontend.
However, the instructions in this tutorial apply to any Koji project.
You can start a Koji project by remixing any other template on Koji.
For some great starting points, check out the https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds[Scaffolds] page.

. Go to the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match[Element Match] project.
. {blank}
+
include::../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
+
After a short loading time, the *Project Details* page opens.

== Cloning the Git repository

When you remix a project, Koji creates a new fork of the project's Git repository for you.
This new repository has a unique identifier string.
If you fork the same project twice, you will get a different identifier string each time.
The Koji repositories are stored at
`\https://projects.koji-cdn.com/`.

To clone your Koji repository locally, you need these strings:

* The *repository URL* on `\https://projects.koji-cdn.com/`.
* The *username* that you created when you registered with Koji.
* An *access token*, which you must generate and store securely.

You need to use the repository URL only once, you should know your username by heart, and the access token is a 32-character, randomly-generated hexadecimal number, which you need to note in a safe place.

=== Obtaining the repository URL

To find the URL of the Koji repository:

. On the left side of the Koji editor, go to *Advanced > Repository info*.
+
The Repository information tab shows links to two repositories.
+
image::remote-repository.png[Remote repository URL in the Koji editor,title="Remote repository URL"]
. Copy the URL for the remote repository.
+
The *remote repository* is the personal repository for your template.
+
NOTE: The *upstream repository* is the repository from which your project was forked.
If your intention is to propose improvements to the original project, then you can modify your remote repository and subsequently create pull requests, so that the developer can evaluate your proposed changes and update the project accordingly.

=== Obtaining an access key

To clone your Koji repository locally, you must generate an access key and store it securely.
Access keys are strong, randomly-generated, 32-character hexadecimal strings that you generate to allow programmatic access to your Koji projects.

. From any page on https://withkoji.com[withkoji.com], click your avatar in the top right, and then click *Settings*.
+
. Expand the menu on the left side, and click *Access keys*.
. Click *Generate new token* in the top right.
+
A window opens to display the new access key.
. Copy the access key and keep it somewhere safe, where only you can find it.
+
You will need to use this key each time you clone, pull, or push to the origin repository.
+
WARNING: After you close the window, the access key will be displayed only by name (for example, `Token 1`).
You will not be able to retrieve it from the Koji site again.
You can, however, revoke your token and generate a new one if you have forgotten it, or if you believe that someone unauthorized has discovered it.

=== Authorizing Git to clone the repository

. Open a terminal window, and go to the directory on your local machine where you want to save your project.
. Run the following command.
+
Replace `[repository URL]` with the URL that you copied in the previous procedure and `[directory name]` with the name of the directory that you want Git to create for your project.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone [repository URL] [directory name]
----
+
Your terminal will look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ git clone https://projects.koji-cdn.com/a70f8329-e89e-48b0-8d85-7658c1542b9f.git MyKojiTemplate
Cloning into 'MyKojiTemplate'...
Username for 'https://projects.koji-cdn.com':
----
. At the username prompt, enter your username on Koji and press *Enter*.
. At the password prompt, enter the access key that you generated in the previous procedure.
+
For security, the password will not be shown as you enter it.
. Press *Enter* to start the cloning process.
+
Your terminal will look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ git clone https://projects.koji-cdn.com/a70f8329-e89e-48b0-8d85-7658c1542b9f.git MyKojiTemplate <1>

<1> Your repository URL and local directory
<2> Your Koji username
<3> Your access key

== Confirming your local directory

You should now have a new directory on your local machine that contains downloaded files from the origin repository.

To confirm that the project has been cloned correctly:

. Open a terminal window, and go to the directory that you specified when you cloned the repository.
. List the directory contents.
+
Your terminal should look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ cd MyKojiTemplate/
~/Repos/Koji$ ls -al
total 40
drwxrwxr-x  6 kojicoder dev 4096 nov  5 16:38 .

== Next steps

In this part of the tutorial, you learned how to:

* Get the required tools: Git, Node.js, a Terminal application and a text editor.
* Get the URL of Koji's origin repository for your project.
* Get the username and password that allows you to interact with Koji's origin repository.
* Clone the Git repository for your project onto your local machine.

Before you can launch your project locally, you must install a set of Node module dependencies.
