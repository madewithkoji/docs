:page-description: How to use Git to clone a Koji project template to your development machine, so that you can work on it locally.
:figure-caption!:

Git is the version control system used by Koji. You use it to handle your projects and keep track of the changes to them.
In the first section of this tutorial, you will
// tag::description[]
clone a Koji project to your development machine, so that you can work on it locally.
// end::description[]

== Prerequisites

To develop your Koji project locally, you need these tools:

. The open-source *Git* version control system.
+
Koji stores each template and each remixed project as a separate Git repository.
To work on a project locally, you will use Git to download a clone of your project to your local machine.
You can then make changes and use Git to push the changes back to the origin repository on the Koji servers.
+
This tutorial assumes that you already have https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed on your computer, and that you are familiar with the basic Git commands.
If you need to install Git on your computer, follow the instructions in the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git documentation].
. The open-source *Node.js* server environment.
+
Koji uses Node.js and many add-on packages to deliver your web application to your users' browsers.
You will need to https://nodejs.org/en/download/[install Node.js] and its associated Node Package Manager (NPM) to run a Node server on your development computer.
. A *terminal* application.
+
You will be typing commands that use git and npm to set up your development environment.
Depending on your operating system, the application you use will be different.
Here are some suggestions:
+
* https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line[Terminal] on macOS
* https://msysgit.github.io/[GitBash] on Windows
* https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/[Linux Terminal] on Linux
. A *text editor*.
+
You will use a text editor to edit your code, and save it as plain-text files.
A text editor that is designed for writing code can help you in many ways, such as verifying structure and syntax or finding the correct variables or function names.
For more information, see this https://kinsta.com/blog/best-text-editors/[list of recommended text editors], which includes several that are excellent and free.

== Choosing a template for your project

This tutorial uses the *Element Match* template as an example because it illustrates a completed game with code that runs both on the backend and on the frontend.
However, the instructions in this tutorial apply to any Koji project.
You can start a Koji project by remixing any other template on Koji.
For some great starting points, check out the https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds[Scaffolds] page.

. Go to the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match[Element Match] project.
. {blank}
+
include::../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
+
After a short loading time, the *Project Details* page opens.

== Cloning the Git repository

When you remix a project, Koji creates a new fork of the project's Git repository for you.
This new repository has a unique identifier string.
If you fork the same project twice, you will get a different identifier string each time.
The Koji repositories are stored at
`\https://projects.koji-cdn.com/`.

To clone your Koji repository locally, you need these strings:

* The *username* that you created when you registered with Koji.
* An *access token*, which you must generate and store securely.
+
The access token is a 32-character randomly-generated hexadecimal number, which you can use instead of a password when cloning your repositories.
* The values of the `KOJI_PROJECT_ID` and `KOJI_PROJECT_TOKEN` environment variables, if the project has a backend component.
* The values of the `KOJI_CREATOR_USERNAME` and `KOJI_CREATOR_PROFILE_PICTURE` environment variables, if you want to use platform-provided metadata about the creator in the project.

=== Obtaining an access key

To clone your Koji repository locally, you must generate an access key and store it securely.
Access keys are strong, randomly-generated, 32-character hexadecimal strings that you generate to allow programmatic access to your Koji projects.

. From *Project Details*, click *Clone*.
A dialog similar to the following opens.
+
image::git-clone.png[]
. Click *Manage access keys*.
The *Access Keys* page opens in a new tab.
. Click *Generate new token* in the top right.
+
A window opens to display the new access key.
. Copy the access key and keep it somewhere safe, where only you can find it.
+
You will need to use this key each time you clone, pull, or push to the origin repository.
+
WARNING: After you close the window, the access key will be displayed only by name (for example, `Token 1`).
You will not be able to retrieve it from the Koji site again.
You can, however, revoke your token and generate a new one if you have forgotten it, or if you believe that someone unauthorized has discovered it.

=== Obtaining Koji environment variables

If your project has a backend, you need the values of the `KOJI_PROJECT_ID` and `KOJI_PROJECT_TOKEN` environment variables to access it.
Additional environment variables are available for accessing platform-provided metadata about the Koji's creator.

. If the Clone dialog is not already open, return to the browser tab for *Project Details*, and click *Clone*.
+
The first line of text under *Environment Variables* is the project ID.
. Click the line to highlight it.
. Copy the highlighted line and paste it somewhere to save it for later.
. Do the same with the second line of text, which is the project token.
. Repeat for the next two lines, which provide metadata about the creator.

=== Authorizing Git to clone the repository

. If the Clone dialog is not already open, return to the browser tab for *Project Details*, and click *Clone*.
. Click the line of text under *Repository* in the dialog box to highlight it.
This line has the form `git clone \https://projects.koji-cdn.com/[[unique identifier]].git`, where [unique identifier] is the identifier for the repository directory on `\https://projects.koji-cdn.com/`.
. Copy the highlighted line to the clipboard.
. Open a terminal window, and go to the directory on your local machine where you want to save your project.
. Paste the line you copied to the clipboard.
. Append a space followed by a name for the directory that you want Git to create for your project.
The line should have the following format:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone [repository URL] [directory name]
----
+
. Press `Enter` to run the command.
Your terminal will look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ git clone https://projects.koji-cdn.com/a70f8329-e89e-48b0-8d85-7658c1542b9f.git MyKojiTemplate
Cloning into 'MyKojiTemplate'...
Username for 'https://projects.koji-cdn.com':
----
. If you are prompted for your username, enter your username on Koji and press *Enter*.
. If you are prompted for a password, enter the access key that you generated in the previous procedure.
+
For security, the password will not be shown as you enter it.
. Press *Enter* to start the cloning process.
+
Your terminal will look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ git clone https://projects.koji-cdn.com/a70f8329-e89e-48b0-8d85-7658c1542b9f.git MyKojiTemplate <1>

== Confirming your local directory

You should now have a new directory on your local machine that contains downloaded files from the origin repository.

To confirm that the project has been cloned correctly:

. Open a terminal window, and go to the directory that you specified when you cloned the repository.
. List the directory contents.
+
Your terminal should look something like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
~/Repos/Koji$ cd MyKojiTemplate/
~/Repos/Koji$ ls -al
total 40
drwxrwxr-x  6 kojicoder dev 4096 nov  5 16:38 .

== Wrapping up

In this part of the tutorial, you learned how to:

* Get the required tools: Git, Node.js, a Terminal application and a text editor.
* Get the URL of Koji's origin repository for your project.
* Get the username and password that allows you to interact with Koji's origin repository.
* Clone the Git repository for your project onto your local machine.

Before you can launch your project locally, you must install a set of Node module dependencies.
