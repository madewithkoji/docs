:page-description: Guide for the Koji editor, a browser-based IDE for developing and testing Koji templates.

The Koji editor is browser-based integrated development environment (IDE).
You can use the Koji editor to create application and game templates.
The editor contains all of your project's code, Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) generated from the project's code, interfaces for publishing and deployment management, and interfaces to other production tools such as the Koji database.

== Overview

The Koji editor is divided into these sections:

* *Project pane* – Lists project menu items and source code.
* *Editing pane* – Displays open files.
Supports multiple tabs.
* *Preview pane* – Displays a live preview of the template and provides other testing and debugging tools.
* *Terminal pane* – Provides command line access to the project's services.
Supports multiple tabs and can be collapsed.

== Koji editor code hosting and source control

Each Koji project is backed by a Git repository.
When you remix a project, Koji clones that project's Git repository to your account and opens it in the editor.
When you publish your application from the editor, Koji commits your changes and pushes to master.
This push triggers a deploy.
You can think of the state of your Koji editor in the same way as the state of a Git repository on your computer -- that is, it is a working HEAD of your repository.
This means that if you make changes to your project from outside the Koji editor, you must `git pull` those changes from within the Koji editor to see them.

If you would like to use a remote editor, you must generate a Git Access Token from your Account Settings.
You can use this access token in place of a password when cloning your repositories.
To find the remote URL of your project's Git repository, navigate to *Settings > Repository* from within the Koji editor.

For in-depth walkthroughs of working outside the Koji editor, see <<use-git#>>.

== Previews

=== Inline preview

The Live Preview in the editor is a running preview of your template.

The live preview provides these additional options:

* *Editing* and *Preview* modes – Toggles between application *Preview* mode and *Editing* mode, which represents what remixers see when customizing values.
* *Refresh* – Updates the preview with the latest version of your project code.
* *Show Logs* – Opens a pane showing the console logs of your project.
This is useful for debugging runtime errors or incorrect behaviors.

=== Remote preview

The *Remote* tab enables you to test your template in a new tab or on another device by scanning the QR code.
You can even share the remote preview link with someone else, and they can see the preview as you develop.

[NOTE]
The remote preview link will only work for as long as your editor session is still active, so it is not suitable for long-term sharing.

When your template preview is open in another tab, you still have access to the console logs of the remote device.
This allows you test your template on different devices and computers while working in the editor, including things like debugging different browsers, operating systems, and form factors.

== Route testing

The *Routes* tab is used for testing backend routes.
You can build your request and then click *Send Request* to execute it.
The *Fetch* tab generates a code snippet for the current request that you can easily add to your application's frontend.
