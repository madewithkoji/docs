:includespath: ../_includes

The Koji code editor is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to develop and test your Koji.
The code editor provides easy access to the following:

* All of your project's code.
* Tools to preview and test your Koji.
* Tools to publish and deploy your Koji.

== Opening a project in the Koji code editor

include::{includespath}/images-annotated.adoc[tag=editorsections]

== Koji source control

Each Koji project is stored in a Git repository in the cloud.

When you fork an existing project or scaffold, the Git repository of that project/scaffold is copied to your account.

When you use the code editor to publish your Koji, the code editor commits your changes and pushes the updated files to the `master` branch.
This push triggers the deployment process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you made changes to your project files xref:work-locally.adoc[outside the Koji editor], you must update the project files before editing them in the code editor again.

. In the Koji code editor, expand the terminal pane.
. Run `git pull`.

== Previewing your Koji

=== Previews in the code editor

If your template includes different contexts, you can select which context is displayed in the preview pane.

* *Default* - Displays a fully functional preview of your Koji.
The *Default* context is always enabled.

* *Remix* - Displays what remixers see when customizing your Koji.

* *More* - Displays a menu of additional previews.

** *Receipt (seller)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the seller, if you implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

** *Receipt (buyer)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the buyer, if you implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

** *Thumbnail* - Displays how your Koji will look if it's shared on social media.

=== Previews outside the code editor

You can also preview a Koji outside the code editor.

* The QR code button image:{imagesDir}/QRcode.svg[QR code button] displays a QR code for your Koji.
Scan this code to preview the Koji on your mobile device.

* The remote staging button image:{imagesDir}/remote-preview.svg[Remote staging button] opens a preview of your Koji in a new browser tab.

=== Debugging

To open the debugger in a new browser tab, click *Launch Debugger*.
