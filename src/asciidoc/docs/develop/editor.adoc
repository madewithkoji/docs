:includespath: ../_includes

The Koji Code Editor is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to develop and test a first-generation Koji.
The Code Editor provides easy access to the following:
[.singlespaced]
* All of your project's code
* Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) generated from the project's code
* Production tools and assets, such as the Koji database
* Tools to publish and deploy your Koji


== Overview

To create a new Koji, you must set up a project and open it in the Koji Code Editor.
[.singlespaced]
. Create a project.

. {blank}
+
include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=open-in-code-editor]

To update an existing Koji, simply open the associated project in the Koji Code Editor.
[.singlespaced]
. {blank}

include::{includespath}/steps-codeeditor.adoc[tag=openproject]

. {blank}

== Koji source control

Each Koji project is stored in a Git repository in the cloud.

When you fork an existing project or scaffold:
[.singlespaced]
* The Git repository of that project/scaffold is copied to your account.
* A new project is created and opened in the Code Editor.

When you use the Code Editor to publish your Koji, the Code Editor commits your changes and pushes the updated files to the `master` branch.
This push triggers the deployment process.


.Using other editors
****
You can use other editors instead of the Koji Code Editor and still access your Git repository.

To determine the URL of your project's Git repository:
[.singlespaced]
. Open your project in the Code Editor.
. Navigate to *Advanced > Repository Info*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you made changes to your project files xref:work-locally.adoc[outside the Koji editor], you must update the project files before editing them in the Code Editor again.
[.singlespaced]
. In the Koji Code Editor, expand the terminal pane.
. Run `git pull`.

== Previewing your Koji

You can select what is displayed in the preview pane.

* *Default* - Displays a fully functional preview of your Koji.

* *Remix* - Displays what remixers see when customizing your Koji.

To learn more about using previews, see <<testing-templates#_testing_in_the_koji_editor,Testing in the Koji editor>>.


=== Previews outside the Code Editor

You can also preview a Koji outside the Code Editor.

* The QR code button image:{imagesDir}/QRcode.svg[QR code button] displays a QR code for your Koji.
Scan this code to preview the Koji on your mobile device.

* The remote staging button image:{imagesDir}/remote-staging.svg[Remote staging button] opens a preview of your Koji in a new browser tab.


== Debugging

To open the debugger in a new browser tab, click *Launch Debugger*.
