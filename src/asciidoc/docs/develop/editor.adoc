:page-description: Guide for the Koji editor, a browser-based IDE for developing and testing Koji templates.

The Koji editor is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE).
You can use the Koji editor to create application and game templates.
The editor contains all of your project's code, Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) generated from the project's code, interfaces for publishing and deployment management, and interfaces to other production tools such as the Koji database.

== Overview

The Koji editor is divided into these sections:

* *Navigation pane* – Lists menu items and source code.
* *Editing pane* – Displays open files.
Supports multiple tabs.
* *Preview pane* – Displays a live preview of the template and provides other testing and debugging tools.
* *Terminal pane* – Provides command line access to the project's services.
Supports multiple tabs and can be collapsed.

== Koji editor code hosting and source control

Each Koji project is backed by a Git repository.
When you remix a project, Koji clones that project's Git repository to your account and opens it in the editor.
When you publish your application from the editor, Koji commits your changes and pushes to master.
This push triggers a deploy.
You can think of the state of your Koji editor in the same way as the state of a Git repository on your computer -- that is, it is a working HEAD of your repository.
This means that if you make changes to your project from outside the Koji editor, you must `git pull` those changes from within the Koji editor to see them.

If you would like to use a remote editor, you must generate a Git access token.
You can use this access token in place of a password when cloning your repositories.
To find the remote URL of your project's Git repository, go to *Advanced > Repository Info* in the Koji editor.

For in-depth walkthroughs of working outside the Koji editor, see <<use-git#>>.

== Previews

You can select the type of preview to display in the preview pane.
See <<testing-templates.adoc#_using_previews,using previews>>.
The following types are available.

=== Default

Selecting *Default* shows a running preview of your template.

* *Receipt (seller)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the seller, if you've implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

* *Receipt (buyer)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the buyer, if you've implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

* *Sticker* - Displays how your template will look if it's imbedded in another template.

* *Thumbnail* - Displays how your template will look if it's shared on social media.

=== Remote previews

The preview pane provides options for previewing a template on different devices or in different environments.
You can preview your template outside of the Koji editor using the following buttons.

* The QR code button image:QRcode.png[QR code button] displays a QR code for the template.
You can scan this code to preview the template on your mobile device.

* The remote staging button image:remote-staging.png[Remote staging button] opens a preview of your template in a new browser tab.

=== Launching the debugger

*Launch Debugger* opens the debugger in a new browser tab.
