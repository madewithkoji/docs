:page-description: Guide for the Koji code editor, a browser-based IDE for developing and testing your Koji app.
:includespath: ../_includes

The Koji code editor is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to develop and test your Koji app.
The code editor provides easy access to the following:

* All of your app's code.
* Tools to preview and test your app.
* Tools to publish and deploy your app.

== Opening an app in the Koji code editor

== Koji source control

Each Koji app is stored in a Git repository in the cloud.

When you fork an existing app or scaffold, the Git repository of that app/scaffold is copied to your account.

When you use the code editor to publish your Koji app, the code editor commits your changes and pushes the updated files to the `master` branch.
This push triggers the deployment process.

IMPORTANT: If you made changes to your application files outside the Koji editor, you must <<publish-locally-developed#_updating_the_koji_code_editor_to_match_your_local_environment, update the application files>> before editing them in the code editor again.

== Previewing your Koji app

=== Previews in the code editor

If your app includes different contexts, you can select which context is displayed in the preview pane.

* *Default* - Displays a fully functional preview of your Koji app.
The *Default* context is always enabled.

* *Remix* - Displays what a creator sees when customizing your Koji app.

* *More* - Displays a menu of additional previews.

** *Receipt (seller)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the seller, if you implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

** *Receipt (buyer)* - Displays a preview of the transaction receipt for the buyer, if you implemented in-app purchases and enabled the dynamic receipts entitlement.

** *Thumbnail* - Displays how your Koji app will look if it's shared on social media.

=== Previews outside the code editor

You can also preview a Koji app outside the code editor.

* The QR code button image:{imagesDir}/QRcode.svg[QR code button] displays a QR code for your app.
Scan this code to preview the app on your mobile device.

* The remote staging button image:{imagesDir}/remote-preview.svg[Remote staging button] opens a preview of your app in a new browser tab.

NOTE: The staging location is available only while the Koji code editor is active.

=== Debugging

To open the debugger in a new browser tab, click *Launch Debugger*.
For more information, go to <<testing-apps#_using_the_koji_debugger, Using the Koji debugger>>.

== Publishing your Koji app

You can publish your app from the code editor.

. Under *Project*, click btn:[Publish Now].
. Enter a name for the project.
. (Optional) Configure other settings.
. Click btn:[Publish New Version].
. After your app is published, click the link in the success message to view it.
+
You can share this permalink URL with collaborators and testers.
If you update and republish your app, the link remains the same.

== Tips

* While editing a plain text file, such as .js, .html, or .json, you can open menus with additional editing options.
