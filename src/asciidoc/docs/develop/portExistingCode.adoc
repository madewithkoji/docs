:page-description: How to import code from an existing repository and make it remixable on Koji.
:includespath: ../_includes

In this tutorial, you will port an existing game to Koji.
You will make some updates to the game to make it customizable, and then you will build and deploy the game to the Koji platform.

*Time*: 30 minutes

== Prerequisites

include::{includespath}/prereqs.adoc[tag=gitbasic]
include::{includespath}/prereqs.adoc[tag=remixproc]
include::{includespath}/prereqs.adoc[tag=customvcc]

== Starting from a scaffold

Because every template on Koji is a remix, you will want to find a good place to start from.
There are scaffolds for many existing application frameworks, including Phaser, P5, and React.

In this case, you will be working with a vanilla JS game, so you will use an even simpler starting point.

All games and applications on Koji need to be "built" for production, meaning that they need to be compiled into assets that can be bundled and served statically.
One solution that is very good at bundling code into a static module is webpack.

Webpack enables you to create a hot-reloading development environment and build your game for production, as well.
It also allows for transpiling of advanced JavaScript features using Babel.
The trickiest part about webpack is configuring it correctly.
Fortunately, there is a scaffold that has already implemented webpack for you.

. Open the following scaffold.
+
https://withkoji.com/~RachelSienko06/simple-webpack-ir-scaffold[Simple Webpack IR Scaffold]
. {blank}
include::../_includes/remixNav.adoc[tag=all]
+
After a short loading time, the Koji editor opens.
. Verify that the project is working.
.. Open *VCC Explorer > App settings* on the left side of the editor.
.. Change "Hello world!" to something else.
+
If everything is working correctly, you should see the preview on the right update automatically with your new value.

== Bringing in existing code

There are many ways to bring existing code into your Koji project.
If you have private files to import, you could share them using a service and bring them in with something like wget.

For this example, you will import files from a https://github.com/arist0tl3/HTML5-Asteroids[public git repository].
This sample repository is a fork of a http://www.dougmcinnes.com/2010/05/12/html-5-asteroids[basic Asteroids clone made in vanilla JS].

. In the Koji editor, open the `frontend` terminal, and cancel the running process (for example, press *Ctrl+C*).
. Clone the Asteroids repository into a temp folder.
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/arist0tl3/HTML5-Asteroids temp
. Go to the temp folder, and move the important files into the parent folder.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd temp
mv game.js index.html ipad.js jquery-1.4.1.min.js vector_battle_regular.typeface.js ../
----
. Go back to the parent folder, and remove the temporary folder.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ..
rm -rf temp
----
. Replace the existing `index.js` file with the new `game.js` file.
[source,bash]
rm index.js && mv game.js index.js
. Run the start command, to refresh the preview and see the Asteroids game.
[source,bash]
npm start

== Making a remixable template

By design, every template on Koji is remixable.
In this example, you will add customizable elements to the Asteroids game by leveraging one of the most powerful tools on the platform: Visual Customization Controls (VCCs).

VCCs enable other people who remix your game or application to change things, without looking at one line of code.
Another way to think about this is "theming" or "reskinning" an application -- the underlying code isn't changing, just the assets.

Let's say you want to make the background color of the game customizable.
You need to do two things: set up a VCC to handle the user input, and consume the value inside the application.

. To set up the VCC, open *VCC Explorer > App settings* on the left side of the editor, and then click *Code* view at the top of the file.
. Paste the following code into the file, and then press *Ctrl+S* to save the file.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "settings": {
    "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
  },
  "@@editor": [
    {
      "key": "settings",
      "name": "App settings",
      "icon": "⚙️",
      "source": "settings.json",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "backgroundColor",
          "name": "Background Color",
          "type": "color"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This code replaces the existing values because that value won't be used in the template.
+
If you switch to the *Visual* view at the top of the file, you'll now see that the editor has rendered a color picker so that the user can choose a new background color.
+
If you change the background color, however, you will notice that nothing happens in the template.
You need to set up the template to consume that value, which you can do with the @withkoji/vcc package.
+
[NOTE]
====
This package has already been installed in this project.
If you need to use it in another project, run:

`npm install @withkoji/vcc`
====
+
Because this project is written in vanilla JS, you can use simple dom manipulation to change the background color.
. Open the `frontend/index.html` file.
+
Notice the canvas element, with an `id` of `canvas`.
You will target this element for the background color.
. Open the `frontend/index.js` file, and add the following code to the top of the file, below the initial comment.
+
[source,javascript]
----
const InstantRemixing = require('@withkoji/vcc').InstantRemixing;
const instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

const upgradeBGColor = (bgcolor) => {
  let canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas) {
    canvas.style.backgroundColor = bgcolor;
  }
};

// Set the initial bg color
upgradeBGColor(instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'backgroundColor']));

// Listen for updates
instantRemixing.onValueChanged((path, newValue) => {
  if (path[0] && path[0] === 'settings' && path[1] && path[1] === 'backgroundColor') {
    upgradeBGColor(newValue);
  }
});

let remixing = false;

// Listen for remix mode
instantRemixing.onSetRemixing((isRemixing) => {
  remixing = isRemixing;
});

document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    if (!remixing) return;
    event.preventDefault();
    instantRemixing.onPresentControl(['settings', 'backgroundColor']);
});

instantRemixing.ready();
----
+
This code instantiates InstantRemixing from the @withkoji/vcc package, gets the background color value from the customization file, finds the canvas element, and assigns the custom background color.
It also monitors changes to the value and updates the background color automatically when a remixer selects a new value.
Finally, it listens for remix mode and, if a user clicks the template while remixing, displays the backgroundColor VCC.
. Refresh your preview.
+
You should now see the correct background color.
If you return to the App settings customization, changing the background color should also update your preview automatically.

== Publishing your template

Before publishing your template, you must `require` the local JavaScript files, so that webpack includes them in the bundle.
You must also add an entitlement to indicate to the Koji platform that the template supports instant remixing.

. Open the `frontend/index.html` file, and remove the `<script>` tags from the top of the file.
+
There should be four of them.
+
NOTE: The `script` tag references work in the development environment because the files are available locally.
To make sure the files are included in the published bundle, you must `require` them, instead.

. Press *Ctrl+S* to save the file.
. Open the `frontend/index.js` file, and add the following code above the block of code you pasted in the previous section:
+
[source,javascript]
----
require('jquery-1.4.1.min.js');
require('vector_battle_regular.typeface.js');
require('ipad.js');
----
. Press *Ctrl+S* to save the file, and make sure the preview is still working.
. In the `.koji/project` folder, create an `entitlements.json` file with the following code.
+
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "entitlements": {
    "InstantRemixing": true
  }
}
----

. When you are ready to see a live build of your project, click *Publish Now* on the left side of the editor.
+
You will be prompted to enter additional information about your template, such as the name and description.
. Click *Publish New Version*.
+
Publishing runs the build commands specified for the project, and then displays a live link to your production template.

== Adding sound effects

After your template has been published, you can enhance it by adding sound effects.
When you moved files from the original Asteroids repo into your project, the `.wav` files were not included.
That's because you will allow users to customize those sounds.

. Open the *App settings* customization, and open the *Code* view.
. Replace the contents with the following code.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "settings": {
    "gameOptions": {
      "backgroundColor": "#d3c1c1",
      "laserSound": "",
      "explosionSound": ""
    }
  },
  "@@editor": [
    {
      "key": "settings",
      "name": "App settings",
      "icon": "⚙️",
      "source": "settings.json",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "gameOptions",
          "name": "Game options",
          "type": "object<GameOption>",
          "typeOptions": {
            "GameOption": {
              "backgroundColor": {
                "name": "Background Color",
                "type": "color"
              },
              "laserSound": {
                "name": "Laser Sound",
                "type": "sound"
              },
              "explosionSound": {
                "name": "Explosion Sound",
                "type": "sound"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
. Press *Ctrl+S* to save the file, and then return to the *Visual* view.
+
You should now see two additional pickers that allow a user to choose sounds for your game.
. Open the `frontend/index.js` file, and add the following code below the `upgradeBGColor` function.
+
This code sets the initial sounds based on the customization files and adds a function for dynamically loading sounds.
+
[source,javascript]
----
// Set the initial sounds
let laserSound = instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'gameOptions', 'laserSound']);
let explosionSound = instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'gameOptions', 'explosionSound']);

const loadAudio = () => {
  SFX = {
    laser: new Audio(laserSound),
    explosion: new Audio(explosionSound),
  };

  // preload audio
  for (var sfx in SFX) {
    (function () {
      var audio = SFX[sfx];
      SFX[sfx] = function () {
        return audio.play();
      }
    })();
  }
};
----
. Update the `onValueChanged` listener to monitor changes to the sound values.
+
[source,javascript]
----
// Listen for updates
instantRemixing.onValueChanged((path, newValue) => {
  if (path[0] && path[0] === 'settings' && path[1] && path[1] === 'gameOptions') {
    laserSound = newValue.laserSound;
    explosionSound = newValue.explosionSound;
    upgradeBGColor(newValue.backgroundColor);
    loadAudio();
  }
});
----
. Press *Ctrl+F* to open the finder tool, and enter `.wav` to search for the WAV files and audio preloading that the game was using.
+
It should look like the following example.
+
[source,javascript]
----
SFX = {
  laser:     new Audio('39459__THE_bizniss__laser.wav'),
  explosion: new Audio('51467__smcameron__missile_explosion.wav')
};

// preload audio
for (var sfx in SFX) {
  (function () {
    var audio = SFX[sfx];
    SFX[sfx] = function () {
      return audio.play();
    }
  })();
}
----

. Replace the code you found with a call to your new `loadAudio` function.
+
[source,javascript]
----
loadAudio();
----
. Press *Ctrl+S* to save the file.
+
The template now references the user-selected values for those sounds.
You can return to the *App settings* configuration, and use the sound pickers to replace these sounds with whatever you want.
You can even try just recording some sounds yourself.
For example, you can try "pew" for the laser and "pow!" for the explosion.
+
Changes to the sound choices should trigger a refresh of your template, and you should be able to hear the new sounds.
. Publish your changes to release an updated version of your template.

== Wrapping up
