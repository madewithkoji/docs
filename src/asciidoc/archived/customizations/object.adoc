= Object (composition) (deprecated)
:page-slug: object
:page-description: Composition control for defining an object that is composed of multiple VCCs.

The object control lets you
//tag::description[]
define an object that is composed of multiple VCCs.
//end::description[]
For example, imagine you are making a game that let users define multiple enemies.
Each enemy might need a few pieces of metadata, like a name, image, strength level, and hitpoints.
You can use the object type to compose a custom VCC that defines an enemy, and then optionally extend it as an array to create a list of enemies.
