:page-description: Package for tracking custom events in your Koji templates.

include::../../docs/_includes/deprecatedPackage.adoc[tag=all]

The @withkoji/analytics package enables you to
//tag::description[]
track custom events in your Koji templates.
//end::description[]
For example, track onClick events for the links and buttons in a Koji.

To view the analytics data for your published Koji, go to *Manage this Koji > Open Creator Dashboard > Open Analytics*.
You will see data for your custom events along with a standard set of built-in metrics, which are calculated from the Koji's access logs.

TIP: Analytics data is processed at frequent intervals throughout the day.
If you are testing the custom events in a published template and you don't see results at first, wait 10 minutes to account for data processing latency, and then check again.
