:page-description: Modifying the thumbnail preview when the game is shared on socials
:figure-caption!:

The very last thing we need to do before releasing our new game into the wild, is to customize the thumbnail preview, so when users share their remixes, they get nice little previews that people will click on!

During this section, we will edit the existing `Screenshot` component to include our collectibles and create a "fake" screenshot using our assets.

== How it works

Basically, whatever we render inside of `frontend/src/Components/Screenshot/index.js` will be rendered in the thumbnail preview that people see when this game is shared on socials.

[NOTE]
You can see what your thumbnail preview currently looks like in the `Thumbnail` tab of the http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger[Debugger], or inside the Live Preview from your web editor

== Editing the Screenshot component

By default, this component already shows `imgPlayer` in the center.

It looks something like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

=== Moving the player down

Let's move the player down a bit. To do that, just change the `top` value to something like `80%`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '80%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

=== Adding Collectible images

Now, let's add some `Collectible` images by duplicating the player's `FeaturedImage` below, and changing their positions around. They don't have to be exactly the same, you can play around and see what you like best. You can even randomize their positions if you want!

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '35%',
        top: '25%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '75%',
        top: '35%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '45%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>
-------------------

Once done, your thumbnail preview should look something like this:
