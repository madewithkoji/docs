:page-description: Modifying the preview image when the game is shared on social media.
:figure-caption!:

In the <<game-remix#, previous section>> of the remixable game tutorial, you added an option for users to customize the collectible image.
There's one more thing to take care of before releasing your new game into the wild.

In this section, youâ€™ll
// tag::description[]
customize the preview image that is displayed when users share their remixes on social media.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Adding collectibles to the `Screenshot` component.
* Testing a custom preview image.

In this section, we'll edit the existing `Screenshot` component to include our collectibles and create a "fake" screenshot using our assets.

== How it works

When users share their remixes on social media, the preview (Open Graph) image is based on a screenshot of the Koji.
A fun, custom preview image helps make sure that people are drawn to click on it.

In the game template, `frontend/src/Components/Screenshot/index.js` is already set up to render a custom view for the preview screenshot.

NOTE: To see what the thumbnail preview currently looks like, use the *Thumbnail* tab of the <<testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger, Debugger>> or the Live Preview in the Koji editor.

== Editing the Screenshot component

By default, the `Screenshot` component already shows `imgPlayer` in the center.
It looks something like the following.

[source,html]
----
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>
----

To move the player down a bit, change the `top` value to something like `80%`.

[source,javascript]
----
<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '80%'
    }}
/>
----

Next, add some collectible images.

. Copy and paste the `FeaturedImage` code several times below the original.
. In each copy (but not in the original), change `remixValues.imgPlayer` to `remixValues.imgCollectible`.
. Change the values for `left` and `top` in each copy.
They don't have to be exactly the same as the examples.
You can play around and see what you like best.
You can even randomize their positions if you want!

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgPlayer, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '80%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '50%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '35%',
        top: '25%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '75%',
        top: '35%'
    }}
/>

<FeaturedImage
    src={optimizeImage(remixValues.imgCollectible, 150, 150)}
    rotation={randomRange(-30, 30)}
    style={{
        left: '45%',
        top: '50%'
    }}
/>

After you are done, the thumbnail preview should look something like this example.

== Wrapping up

*Congratulations!*
You've reached the end of the tutorial!

In the <<game-finishing-up#, final section>>, you'll publish your game and see some suggestions for going forward.
