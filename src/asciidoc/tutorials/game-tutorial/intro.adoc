:page-description: Tutorial for creating a remixable Koji game
:figure-caption!:

In this tutorial, we will go through the process of creating a remixable https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/rxkd[Falling Objects^] game with an existing https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[p5.js Game Template^] as our starting point.

This tutorial assumes you've already gone through the https://developer.withkoji.com/tutorials/getting-started/your-first-project[Getting Started Tutorial^] and are familiar with the basics of Koji.

If you get stuck at any point, feel free to ask for help in our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], or e-mail me at *marko@withkoji.com*

== About the starting template

We are using https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[Game Template] as our starting point because it was made specifically for these types of hyper-casual games, and has a lot of stuff handled for us which saves us quite a bit of time, such as:

- Automatic sound loading
- Improved image loading with optimization
- Integrated live leaderboard without needing to modify any of the backend files
- Easily configurable Remix menu
- One liner calls for spawning special effects like particles and animated text

Check out the template https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1/details/code#README.md[README] for more information!

== Game overview

Falling Objects is a simple game where the player tries to collect as many falling objects as they can without them falling off the screen.

Player loses a life if an object falls down, and the game is over when there are no lives left.

Player moves the character horizontally on the bottom by touching or clicking anywhere on the screen.

== Forking the game template

Let's get started by cloning the https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/game-template-1[Game Template]. You can do that by clicking on the *Koji logo* on the upper right corner, then *Advanced*, then find the *Fork* button.

[NOTE]
Koji web editor is recommended for this tutorial, but you are free to http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/use-git[clone the newly created project to your local environment] if you wish.
