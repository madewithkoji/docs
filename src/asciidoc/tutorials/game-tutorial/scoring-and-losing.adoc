:page-description: Adding collision checks and lose conditions
:figure-caption!:

During this section, we will:

- Check for collision between the `Player` and `Collectible` and add to game score
- Add simple animations to make the game more fun
- Check if a `Collectible` has been missed and have the player lose a life

== Collision checking

To check for collisions between Player and Collectibles, we'll modify `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js` again.

Let's add a new function to do that, and put it in `update()`!

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
import { CollisionCircle } from '../Utils/Collision'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkCollisions();
    }

    checkCollisions() {
        const collectibles = game.findByTag('collectible');

        collectibles.forEach(collectible => {
            if (!collectible.isCollected && CollisionCircle(this, collectible)) {
                collectible.onCollect();
            }
        });
    }
}
-------------------

And we need to define the `onCollect()` function inside `Collectible` in `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...

    
    onCollect() {
        this.isCollected = true;
    }
}
-------------------

First, we use `game.findByTag('collectible')` to get all our `Collectible` objects, then run through each one checking if they are colliding with the `Player`.

[NOTE]
`game.findByTag(tag: string)` works by filtering the game instance's `entities` array and returns a new array containing all entities with the given tag

For that, we're using `CollisionCircle()`, provided by the game template (from `frontend/src/Components/Game/Utils/Collision`), which takes two `Entities` as arguments.

So if we are colliding, and the target `Collectible` hasn't already been collected, we trigger the `onCollect()` handler on the target `Collectible`.

This just sets the `isCollected` flag to true.

=== Animated collecting

Now, we could just remove our Collectible object now and be done with it, but we don't want this to be like any other tutorial. Let's spice things up a bit!

Instead of the Collectible just disappearing upon contact, let's have the Player attract it like a magnet and make it explode into particles! That sounds more fun!

So let's override Collectible's `update()` function, but also keep the original behavior:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import playSound from '../Utils/playSound'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'
import { spawnParticles } from '../Effects/Particle'
import { spawnFloatingText } from '../Effects/FloatingText'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    update(){
        super.update();
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta() * 4;

        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeInCubic, this.animTimer, 1, -0.95);
        
        this.moveTowardsPlayer();

        if (this.animTimer >= 1) this.getCollected();
    }

    moveTowardsPlayer() {
        if (!this.isCollected) return;

        this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8);
        this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8);
        this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12);
        this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12);
    }

    getCollected() {
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;

        spawnParticles(game.player.pos.x, game.player.pos.y, 10, { img: this.img });

        const x = game.player.pos.x;
        const y = game.player.pos.y - game.player.size * 0.75;

        spawnFloatingText("+1", x, y);
        game.addScore(1)
        playSound(game.sounds.collect);
        game.player.pulse();
    }
}
-------------------

Note that we haven't yet defined Player's `pulse()` function, so the game will crash upon a collision. We'll do that next, but first, let's break down this code: 

So, once we set our `isCollected` value to true, things start to happen.

In `handleAnimation()`, we:

* Advance the `animTimer` property by `game.delta() * 4`
** Using `game.delta() * 4` basically means we want our `animTimer` to be incremented by `1` in `0.25` seconds. The higher the multiplier, the faster we increment it.
* Use that `animTimer` value to do some `EasingFunctions` and shrink the scale from 1 to 0.05.
** We're not going all the way to `0` because it might create minor glitches, but either way, it does not make any difference visually, so just a tiny value is fine.

At the same time, in `moveTowardsPlayer()`, we're doing several things at once:

* `this.velocity.y = Smooth(this.velocity.y, 0, 8)` - Gradually disable the existing vertical velocity
* `this.rotSpeed = Smooth(this.rotSpeed, 0, 8)` - Start spinning wildly
* `this.pos.x = Smooth(this.pos.x, game.player.pos.x, 12)`
* `this.pos.y = Smooth(this.pos.y, game.player.pos.y, 12)` - Quickly move towards the player location

Once `animTimer` has gone up to `1` (in about `0.25` seconds, since we're multiplying the delta by `4`), Easing animation will be over and that's when the actual collecting happens with `getCollected()`.

Then, finally, in `getCollected()`, we:

* Set the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`
** This game template already has code that handles removal of entities which have `shouldBeRemoved` flag set, so that's all we need to do to make it happen.
* Spawn `10` particles at Player's position and give them the same image as the `Collectible`.
* Spawn a `+1` floating text a little above the player
* Add `1` to game score
* Play the `collect` sound.
* Call `game.player.pulse()`, which resets Player's "pulse" animation. We don't have that animation yet, so let's set it up!

[NOTE] 
Remember when we assigned `game.player` property to the `gameInstance`? We finally made use of it here. Another way to find the player object among all entities would be to set the `"player"` tag inside of `Player`, then do something like `const player = game.findByTag('player')[0];`.  

Back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Player.js`:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import { Smooth, Ease, EasingFunctions } from '../Utils/EasingFunctions'

export default class Player extends Entity {
    constructor(x, y, options){
        super(x, y, options);
        ...

        this.animTimer = 0;
    }

    update(){
        ...
        this.handleAnimation();
    }

    handleAnimation() {
        if (this.animTimer > 1) return;

        this.animTimer += game.delta();

        const intensity = 0.3;
        this.scale.x = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 + intensity, -intensity);
        this.scale.y = Ease(EasingFunctions.easeOutElastic, this.animTimer, 1 - intensity, +intensity);
    }

    pulse() {
        this.animTimer = 0;
    }
}
-------------------

As you can see, it's a similar animation setup as in `Collectible`.

We're incrementing the `animTimer` property as long as it's below `1`, because our `EasingFunctions` only work for values between `0` and `1`.

Then we modify the scale again, but this time we're using the `easeOutElastic` function, which gives us a nice bouncy effect.

`pulse()` function just resets the `animTimer` to `0`, which restarts the animation.

Now it's looking better!

== Checking for missed collectibles

We need a way to lose the game somehow, too!

To do that, we'll have to check if any of the collectibles went past the player and off the screen.

Let's go back to `frontend/src/Components/Game/Entities/Collectible.js` and add that check:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
import { game } from '..'
import Entity from './Entity'
import playSound from '../Utils/playSound'

export default class Collectible extends Entity {
    ...

    update(){
        ...
        this.checkIfMissed();
    }

    checkIfMissed() {
        if (game.gameOver) return;

        const isBelowScreen = this.pos.y > game.height + this.size / 2;
        if (isBelowScreen) this.onMiss();
    }

    onMiss() {
        game.loseLife();
        playSound(game.sounds.loselife);
        game.camera.shake(0.25, 12);
        this.shouldBeRemoved = true;
    }
}
-------------------

First, we check the Collectible's `pos.y` coordinate, and if it's higher than the lower edge of the screen, we trigger the `onMiss()` function, where we:

* Trigger a `game.loseLife` function.
** The template makes sure that the game automatically ends when there are no lives left.
* Play a `loselife` sound
* Shake the camera a bit to amplify that negative effect
* Set the `shouldBeRemoved` flag to `true`, to make sure our object will be deleted from memory in the next frame.

[NOTE]
Deleting unused objects from memory is an especially important step in every game in order to prevent memory leaks from prolonged gameplay sessions which can result in performance slowdown and eventually a crash

== Wrapping up

At this point, our game is playable!

In the <<game-tutorial-managing-difficulty#,next section>>, we'll add some difficulty management and have the game progressively get harder.
