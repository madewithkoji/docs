:page-description: Modifying the Remix menu
:figure-caption!:

We've finished the main part of our game.
But this is Koji! We don't stop there.

We want our game to be easily remixable by other people so it can be shared everywhere online!

In this section, we will:

- Edit the existing Remix menu.

- Learn how to add a customizable image to the menu.

== Overview

Let's explore a new section of the game template.

If you open `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`, you'll find some workflow already set up.

[NOTE]
You can see what your Remix menu currently looks like in the `Remix` tab of the http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger[Debugger], or inside the Live Preview from your web editor.

*Background Image* and *Music* customization are already handled by the template, so we can just leave them as they are.

Luckily, since we've already made a generic `Player` class that uses `imgPlayer` for its image, everything is already set up for our player to be customizable.

To test it out, try changing the `Player` image.
If necessary, refresh the preview.
Our player is different now!

== Adding the Collectible image to Remix menu

Let's make our `Collectible` image customizable, as well.

=== Setting up state hooks

First, let's make a State Hook that will represent our `Collectible` image, and assign some initial values.
Modify `index.js` as follows.

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [imgCollectible, setImgCollectible] = useState("");
    const [isCollectibleInvalid, setIsCollectibleInvalid] = useState("");
    ...

    const assignInitialValues = () => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        setImgCollectible(remixValues.imgCollectible);

        ...
    })
}
-------------------

Notice that we also created an `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook.
We'll use it to make sure the user has actually uploaded an image.
We don't want them to publish the game without one.

Then, in `assignInitialValues()`, which is inside our useEffect Hook when the Remix component mounts, we assign the initial value from `koji.json`.

`setImgCollectible(remixValues.imgCollectible);`

=== Defining functions that let us change the image

We also need to define some functions that will let us change or delete the collectible image.

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...

    const changeCollectible = async () => {
        const imageUrl = await Koji.ui.capture.image();
        if (!imageUrl || imageUrl === "") return;

        setImgCollectible(imageUrl);
        setIsCollectibleInvalid(false);
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: imageUrl })
        updateGame();
    }

    const deleteCollectible = async () => {
        setImgCollectible("");
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: "" })
        updateGame();
    }

    ...
}
-------------------

To capture our image, we use the `@withkoji/core` package, which lets us upload an image, paste one from a link, or choose one from one of the asset packs.

`Koji.ui.capture.image()` will return `null` if the user cancels image selection, so we also include a simple check to make sure that's not the case.

Then we:

* Update our `imgCollectible` state hook with the resulting image.

* Reset the `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook.

* Update our `imgCollectible` remix value with the resulting image.

* Update the game.

We want to update our game here because we have a running game preview behind our Remix panel.
If you change something isn't instantly previewable inside the game, this step can be skipped.

Inside `deleteCollectible()`, we do the same thing, except we set `imgCollectible` to an empty string, instead of capturing an image.

=== Rendering the image component

Next, let's render the component that represents a collectible image and lets us customize it.
We can once again use the existing structure from `Player`.

Find the component that looks like the following.

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Player"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgPlayer, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeImgPlayer}
        onDelete={deletePlayer}
        isInvalid={isPlayerInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

Make a copy just below it, still inside the `<Section>` component, and modify it as follows.

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Collectible"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgCollectible, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeCollectible}
        onDelete={deleteCollectible}
        isInvalid={isCollectibleInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

=== Updating the finish() function

Lastly, we want to modify the `finish()` function to prevent the user from publishing if they haven't uploaded an image.

That logic is already in place for `imgPlayer`, so we can just modify it to include `imgCollectible`.

[source,javascript]
-------------------
const finish = async () => {
    if (imgPlayer === "" || imgCollectible === "") {
        setErrorLabel("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (imgPlayer === "") {
            setIsPlayerInvalid(true);
        }

        if (imgCollectible === "") {
            setIsCollectibleInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
    })
    Koji.remix.finish();
}
-------------------

[NOTE]
We don't need to explicitly set `imgPlayer` and `imgCollectible` inside the `Koji.remix.set()` function, because we've already done it in our `onChange` handlers.

== Wrapping up

That's our `Remix` mode finished! We've just added the ability for users to change the `Collectible` image!

In the <<game-tutorial-thumbnail-preview#,next section>>, we will customize our thumbnail preview.
