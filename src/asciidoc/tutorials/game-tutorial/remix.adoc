:page-description: Modifying the Remix menu
:figure-caption!:

We've finished the main part of our game. But this is Koji! We don't stop here. 

We want this game to be easily remixable by other people and shared everywhere online!

During this section, we will:

- Edit the existing Remix menu
- Learn how to add a customizable image to the Remix menu

== Overview

Let's explore a new section of the game template.

If you open `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`, you'll find some workflow already set up.

[NOTE]
You can see what your Remix menu currently looks like in the `Remix` tab of the http://developer.withkoji.com/docs/develop/testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger[Debugger], or inside the Live Preview from your web editor

*Background Image* and *Music* customization are already handled by the template, so we can just leave them as they are.

Luckily, since we've already made a generic `Player` class that uses `imgPlayer` for its image, we can take advantage of the template once more because it already has everything set up for our player to be customizable.

To test it out, try changing the `Player` image and going into preview mode. Our player is different now!

== Adding the Collectible image to Remix menu

But what about our `Collectible` image? Let's make that customizable too, using a similar workflow as `Player`.

=== Setting up state hooks

First, let's make a State Hook that will represent our `Collectible` image, and assign the initial values:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [imgCollectible, setImgCollectible] = useState("");
    const [isCollectibleInvalid, setIsCollectibleInvalid] = useState("");
    ...

    const assignInitialValues = () => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        setImgCollectible(remixValues.imgCollectible);

        ...

    })
}
-------------------

Notice that we also created an `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook. We will need this to make sure the user has actually uploaded an image. We don't want them to publish the game without one.

Then in `assignInitialValues()`, which is inside our useEffect Hook when the Remix components mounts, we assign the initial value from `koji.json`:

=== Defining functions that let us change the image

We also need to define some functions that will let us change or delete our collectible image:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
...
const Component = () => {
    ...

    const changeCollectible = async () => {
        const imageUrl = await Koji.ui.capture.image();
        if (!imageUrl || imageUrl === "") return;

        setImgCollectible(imageUrl);
        setIsCollectibleInvalid(false);
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: imageUrl })
        updateGame();
    }

    const deleteCollectible = async () => {
        setImgCollectible("");
        await Koji.remix.set({ imgCollectible: "" })
        updateGame();
    }

}
-------------------

To capture our image, we're using `@withkoji/core` package that lets us easily upload an image, paste one from a link or choose from one of the asset packs.

`Koji.ui.capture.image()` will return `null` in case the user has cancelled image selection, so we also include a simple check to make sure that's not the case.

Then we:

* Update our `imgCollectible` *state hook* with the resulting image
* Reset the `isCollectibleInvalid` state hook
* Update our `imgCollectible` *remix value* with the resulting image
* Update the game

We want to update our game here because we have a running game preview behind our Remix panel. If we change something that wouldn't be instantly previewable inside the game, this step can be skipped.

Inside `deleteCollectible()`, we do the same thing, except we just set our `imgCollectible` to an empty string instead of capturing an image.


=== Rendering the image component

Next, let's render the component which represents a collectible image and lets us customize it. We can once again use the existing structure from `Player`.

Find the component that looks like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Player"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgPlayer, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeImgPlayer}
        onDelete={deletePlayer}
        isInvalid={isPlayerInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

Make a copy just below it, still inside the `<Section>` component, and modify it to look like this:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
<div>
    <Label>
        <b>{"Collectible"}</b>
    </Label>
    <ImageButton
        src={optimizeImage(imgCollectible, 120, 120)}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        onClick={changeCollectible}
        onDelete={deleteCollectible}
        isInvalid={isCollectibleInvalid}
    />
</div>
-------------------

=== Updating the `finish()` function

Lastly, we want to modify the `finish()` function to prevent the user from publishing if they haven't uploaded an image.

It already has that logic handled for `imgPlayer`, so we can just modify it to include `imgCollectible` as well:

[source,javascript]
-------------------
const finish = async () => {
    if (imgPlayer === "" || imgCollectible === "") {
        setErrorLabel("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (imgPlayer === "") {
            setIsPlayerInvalid(true);
        }

        if (imgCollectible === "") {
            setIsCollectibleInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
    })
    Koji.remix.finish();
}
-------------------

[NOTE]
We don't need to explicity set `imgPlayer` and `imgCollectible` inside the `Koji.remix.set()` function, because we've already done it with our `onChange` handlers. Setting them here as well won't make any difference in the final result.

== Wrapping up

That's our `Remix` mode finished! We've just added the ability for users to change the `Collectible` image!

In the <<game-tutorial-thumbnail-preview#,next section>>, we will customize our thumbnail preview.
