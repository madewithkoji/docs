:page-description: Adding functions to handle the payment logic for purchases in a Koji game.
:figure-caption!:

In the <<game-iap-payment-menu#,previous section>> of the in-game purchases tutorial, you created and rendered the Payment Menu UI component.
In this section, youâ€™ll
// tag::description[]
use `Koji.iap` from the @withkoji/core package to handle the payment logic.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Handling payment logic with Koji's built-in functionality.

== Defining the payment functions

Remember how the `PaymentDialog` component needs to call the `onPurchase` and `onPurchaseCancel` functions?
Here, you'll define those functions and pass them into the component.
Update `frontend/src/Components/View/index.js` as follows.

[source,javascript]
----
...
import PaymentDialog from './PaymentDialog'

...

const Component = (props) => {
    ...

    // Create a state hook to control display of PaymentDialog
    const [showPaymentDialog, setShowPaymentDialog] = useState(false);

    ...

    // In case the user proceeds to the leaderboard
    const onPurchaseCancel = () => {
        setShowPaymentDialog(false);
        startScoreSubmission();
    }

    const onPurchase = async () => {
        // Initiating a purchase of "extraLives" product that are defined in koji.json entitlements
        const purchase = await Koji.iap.startPurchase('extraLives');

        // If the purchase object contains a receiptId
        // it means that the purchase was successful
        if (purchase.receiptId) {
            setShowPaymentDialog(false);
            emitEvent('resumeGame');
            emitEvent('resetLives');


            // Submit the score now as backup in case
            // the player closes the game before submitting it later
            if (dataManager.name !== "") {
                await dataManager.submitScore(score);
            }
        }
    }

    return(
        <Container>
            ...

             {showPaymentDialog &&
                <PaymentDialog
                    onPurchase={onPurchase}
                    onPurchaseCancel={onPurchaseCancel}
                />
            }
        </Container>
    )
}
----

The `onPurchaseCancel()` function simply closes the menu and proceeds to the score submission process.

The `onPurchase()` function does a couple of things.

* First, it calls `Koji.iap.startPurchase('extraLives')`.
This initializes the purchase process and opens the payment dialog for the product.

** `extraLives` is the `sku` value you set in the `InAppPurchase` entitlement object earlier in this tutorial.

* If the transaction is successful, the returned `purchase` object will contain a `receiptId` property.
In this case, `onPurchase()` proceeds to:

** Disable the `PaymentDialog` by setting the state hook to false.

** Emit the `resumeGame` event, which is already defined.

** Emit the `resetLives` event.
You'll have to define this event later, since it wasn't part of the original game.

** Submit the score if the player has already submitted their name.
This part is optional, but a good thing to add in case the player happens to close the tab.
That way, at least the latest score will be saved.

[NOTE]
This use case does not require any backend validation.
You simply proceed with the flow if the purchase was successful.
If you wanted to save some data and later check if the user has already purchased something, you would need to check for receipts on the backend.

If you've already saved the file, the game probably crashed because you still need to add the `startScoreSubmission()` function.

== Modifying the onGameOver function

The `onGameOver()` function is already defined in `frontend/src/Components/View/index.js`.
This function is triggered automatically when the game ends.

Locate the function, which looks like this.

[source,javascript]
----
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);
    if (dataManager.name === "") {
        setTimeout(() => {
            setShowNameDialog(true);
            setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
        }, 3000);
    } else {
        await dataManager.submitScore(data.detail.score);

        setTimeout(() => {
            setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
            setShowLeaderboard(true);
        }, 3000);
    }
}
----

Extract the conditional part of `onGameOver()` into a separate `startScoreSubmission()` function, and then modify the results to match the following.

[source,javascript]
----
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);
}

const startScoreSubmission = async () => {
    if (dataManager.name === "") {
        setShowNameDialog(true);
        setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
    } else {
        await dataManager.submitScore(score);

        setGameView(GAME_VIEW.MAIN_MENU);
        setShowLeaderboard(true);
    }
}
----

Notice these important differences in the new `startScoreSubmission()` function.

* The `setTimeout` handlers have been removed.
You no longer need a delay before displaying the Game Over screen and moving to score submission.
That transition is now triggered by user action.

* The argument you're passing to `submitScore()` has changed from `data.detail.score` to just `score`.
Originally, `submitScore()` was called in `onGameOver()`, so it could get the score from the data object that was passed as an argument to `onGameOver()`.
But since `startScoreSubmission()` doesn't accept any arguments, `submitScore()` now gets the score from the variable that's set by the state hook.

Lastly, update `onGameOver()` to behave appropriately based on whether there's a price.

[source,javascript]
----
const onGameOver = async (data) => {
    setScore(data.detail.score);

    const price = Number(Koji.remix.get().price);

    if (price > 0) {
        setShowPaymentDialog(true);
        emitEvent('pauseGame');
    } else {
        startScoreSubmission();
    }
}
----

This code first gets the price from `remixData` and makes sure it's a number.
If there is a price, it shows `PaymentDialog`.
Otherwise, it goes straight to score submission and the leaderboard.

== Wrapping up

*Congratulations, that was the hardest part!*

In this section, you created a payment flow, which you can test in the <<testing-templates#_using_the_koji_debugger, debugger>>.
Nothing happens in the game itself just yet, though.

In the <<game-iap-updating-game#, next section>>, you'll dig into the game code and make it respond to purchases.
