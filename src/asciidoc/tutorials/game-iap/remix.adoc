:page-description: Making the price customizable during Remix
:figure-caption!:

The last thing we need to do is make our price customizable when people remix this game.

During this section, we will:

- Install a new package which handles our price input format
- Set up the price input field
- Make sure our price value is updated

== Installing the new Package

For our price input field, we'll use a premade component that already handles all the proper formatting for us, so we don't have to worry about the user entering characters, incorrect price formats etc.

For that, we are using `@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools` npm package, which is installed in this template because we're already using some of those components.

Another package we will use is `@anderjason/money`, which is *not* installed, so let's go ahead and do it.

On the bottom of your web editor, you'll see a black panel that looks like this:

- Click on `frontend` to expand it
- Inside of it, press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the frontend server
- Type `npm install @anderjason/money`, wait for it to finish
- When it's done, type `npm start` to restart the frontend server

== Price input field

Inside `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`:

Let's add a state hook for our `price`, initialize its value and also set a `maxPrice` constant just to make sure users can't abuse anything.

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { Money, Currency } from "@anderjason/money";

...

const maxPrice = new Money(100000, Currency.ofUSD());

const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [price, setPrice] = useState(new Money(1, Currency.ofUSD()));

    ...

    useEffect(() => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        // Make sure we get a number
        // Multiplied by 100 because Currency uses that format
        const remixPrice = Number(remixValues.price) * 100;
        setPrice(new Money(remixPrice, Currency.ofUSD()));

        ...
    }, [])
}
------------------

Then we want to render the `<MoneyInput>` inside `<Card>`, just below the `<Section>` component that contains the block image.

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { MoneyInput } from "@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools";

...
<Card>
    ...
    <MoneyInput
        placeholderLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        persistentLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        defaultValue={price}
        maxValue={maxPrice}
        onChange={(price) => setPrice(price)}
        allowEmpty
        supportLabel={price && price.rawValue > 0 ? "Set price to 0 to disable In-Game Purchases." : `In-Game Purchases disabled.`}
    />
    ...
</Card>
------------------

We can set its props like in the example above.
For additional clarity, we're setting the `supportLabel` prop of the component to say `In-Game Purchases disabled.` in case the price is empty or `0`, otherwise it will provide instructions on how to do that: `Set price to 0 to disable In-Game Purchases.`

=== Updating the price value

Lastly, we need to update the changed `price` in `koji.json`. To do that, find the `onFinish()` function, still inside the same file, and inside `await Koji.remix.set({...})`, add the following property:

`price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0`

Here, we are just running a check to make sure we don't write a `null` value into `koji.json`, in which case we turn it to `0`.

The resulting `onFinish()` function should now look like this:

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onFinish = async () => {
    if (block === "") {
        setError("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (block === "") {
            setIsBlockInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
        collectEmails,
        imgBlock: block,
        price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0,
    })

    Koji.remix.finish();
}
------------------

We make sure to set the price to `0` in case it's `null`, to prevent future inconsistencies.

And this is what your resulting remix menu should look like:

== Wrapping up

All that's left to do is to publish it from the *Publish Now* menu, and share it everywhere online!

Of course, the project is now your playground. You can go back to modify or add new features, make improvements, anything you can imagine!

You can also post your new game to our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], along with any suggestions and thoughts on how you think we can make this tutorial even better!
