:page-description: Making the price customizable during Remix
:figure-caption!:

In the <<game-assets#,previous section>> of the remixable game tutorial, you DID SOMETHING.
In this section, youâ€™ll
// tag::description[]
DO SOMETHING ELSE.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

The last thing we want to do is to make our price customizable when people remix the game.

In this section, we will:

- Install a new package which handles our price input format.

- Set up the price input field.

- Make sure our price value is updated.

== Installing the new package

For our price input field, we'll use a premade component that already handles all the proper formatting for us, so we don't have to worry about the user entering invalid characters, incorrect price formats, etc.

That component is included in the `@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools` npm package, which is already installed in the template.

Another package we'll need is `@anderjason/money`, which is *not* installed, so let's go ahead and install it.

On the bottom of your web editor, you'll see a black panel with several tabs.
It looks like this.

- Click `frontend` to expand the fontend tab.

You'll see a terminal window running the frontend server.

- Inside the terminal, press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard to stop the server.

- Type `npm install @anderjason/money` and press *Enter*.

- When it's finished installing, type `npm start` to restart the frontend server.

== Price input field

Inside `frontend/src/Components/Remix/index.js`, let's add a state hook for our `price`, initialize its value, and also set a `maxPrice` constant (just to make sure users can't abuse anything).

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { Money, Currency } from "@anderjason/money";

...

const maxPrice = new Money(100000, Currency.ofUSD());

const Component = () => {
    ...
    const [price, setPrice] = useState(new Money(1, Currency.ofUSD()));

    ...

    useEffect(() => {
        const remixValues = Koji.remix.get();
        ...

        // Make sure we get a number
        // Multiplied by 100 because Currency uses that format
        const remixPrice = Number(remixValues.price) * 100;
        setPrice(new Money(remixPrice, Currency.ofUSD()));

        ...
    }, [])
}
------------------

We'll render `MoneyInput` inside the `Card` component, just below the `Section` that contains the block image.

[source,javascript]
------------------
// Don't forget the imports!
import { MoneyInput } from "@anderjason/koji-react-frontend-tools";

...
<Card>
    ...

    <ImageButton
        onClick={() => changeBlock()}
        onDelete={() => deleteBlock()}
        canDelete={canUpdateImages}
        src={block}
        isInvalid={isBlockInvalid}
    />
    <MoneyInput
        placeholderLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        persistentLabel="Price To Refill Lives"
        defaultValue={price}
        maxValue={maxPrice}
        onChange={(price) => setPrice(price)}
        allowEmpty
        supportLabel={price && price.rawValue > 0 ? "Set price to 0 to disable In-Game Purchases." : `In-Game Purchases disabled.`}
    />

    ...
</Card>
------------------

Note that if `price` is empty or `0`, we set `supportLabel` to `"In-Game Purchases disabled."`
Otherwise, we set it to `"Set price to 0 to disable In-Game Purchases."`

=== Updating the price value

Finally, we need to update the changed `price` in `koji.json`.
Find the `onFinish()` function and add the following property inside `await Koji.remix.set({...})`.

`price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0`

Here, we're running a check to make sure we don't write a `null` value into `koji.json`, in which case we substitute `0`.

The resulting `onFinish()` function should look like this.

[source,javascript]
------------------
const onFinish = async () => {
    if (block === "") {
        setError("Complete the required selections to continue.");

        if (block === "") {
            setIsBlockInvalid(true);
        }

        return;
    }

    await Koji.remix.set({
        backgroundImage,
        music,
        title,
        collectEmails,
        imgBlock: block,
        price: price ? price.rawValue / 100 : 0,
    })

    Koji.remix.finish();
}
------------------

And this is what your resulting remix menu should look like.

Go ahead and give it a spin!

== Wrapping up

All that's left to do is to publish the game from the *Publish Now* menu and share it everywhere online!

Of course, the project is now your playground.
You can go back to modify or add new features, make improvements, anything you can imagine!

You can also post your new game to our https://discord.gg/kMkjJQ6Phb[Discord Server], along with any suggestions or thoughts on how we can make this tutorial even better!
