:page-description: Making a project remixable and managing the remixing experience
:figure-caption!:

In the previous section of the Quick Start guide, you learned about contexts and how they help to deliver the remix experience that makes Koji such a powerful platform.
In this section, you'll
// tag::description[]
dive into what you need to do in the code to allow users to remix and publish their own customized versions of your project.
// end::description[]

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Using the `koji.json` file to set your initial remix data.
* Using `get`, `set`, and `finish` methods to manage the remix data and the publish flow.
* Using a `subscribe` method to determine when the user is toggling a live preview.

== Thinking about remixes

As we briefly touched on in <<your-first-remix#,Your first remix>>, every remix that is created from a template utilizes the same code and loads the same web application.
But, as we also learned, each remix can look and behave in dramatically different ways, depending on the customization options exposed by the template.

== How does it work?

If you think about common web applications, such as Facebook, GMail, and Reddit, they all load the same basic JavaScript code, and run it in a browser.
They rely on user-specific data to deliver a different experience to everyone.
And they typically store that user-specific data in a database, which is separate from the code that runs in the browser.

Koji is not much different.
When a user remixes template, the remix will load the same code that the template uses.
To provide the customized remix experience, Koji relies on remix-specific data, data that is also stored in a database and separate from the code that is run in the browser.
The only difference between a template and all the remixes that are created from it is the remix-specific data that is stored in Koji’s database.

So, in order to create a remixable template, you need a way to specify your remix-specific data, collect the values for the data from the user, and store the data in Koji’s database.
Fortunately, the @withkoji/core package does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

Let’s start by going back to your project in the code editor.
If you’ve closed out of the code editor since the last section, you can go to the https://withkoji.com/developer/projects[Developer Portal] to open a list of your projects.

== Working with remix data

If you think back to when we remixed the Bouncy Blast game, there were a few things in that game that the player could customize: the player image, the enemy image, the background image, and the background music.
When a remix is created, the player's choices are stored in a database, and loaded when someone views the remix.

But if you think back to when we previewed the game, it also worked before we created the remix.
That’s because there are a default set of values that are loaded if remix-specific data doesn’t exist.
You can think about remix-specific data as being a layer of data on top of the default data.

== Adding default remix data to koji.json

Let's create a default layer of remix data.
You do that by adding a `remixData` key to the `koji.json` file in the root of your project, and populating it with the default remix data that you want to use.
Open the `/koji.json` file and add a few lines to the end of the file so that it looks like the following.

[source, javascript]
----
{
  "deploy": {
    "frontend": {
      "output": "frontend/build",
      "type": "static",
      "commands": [
        "cd frontend",
        "npm install",
        "export NODE_ENV=production && npm run build"
      ]
    }
  },
  "develop": {
    "frontend": {
      "path": "frontend",
      "port": 8080,
      "startCommand": "npm start"
    }
  },
  "entitlements": {
    "InstantRemixing": true,
    "InstantRemixingNativeNavigation": true,
    "FeedEvents": true
  },
  "remixData": {
    "spinningImageSrc": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg"
  }
}
----

There is quite a lot going on in this file, but for the purposes of this section, we only need to focus on what’s happening in the `remixData` key.

Notice that we’ve added one key/value pair:

`"spinningImageSrc": “https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg"`.

If that value looks familiar, good!
It’s the same value that we were using as the default state value for the spinning image in our project.
By defining it in the `koji.json` file as a `remixData` property, we’re telling Koji that it’s the default value for the `spinningImageSrc` property.

Double-check that your JSON is valid, and make sure you save the changes.

== Using Koji.remix.get to retrieve remix data

We can use the remix module from the @withkoji/core package to start using the default remix data we just stored in the `koji.json` file.

Open `/frontend/src/App.js`.

Change

`const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg');`

to

`const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState(Koji.remix.get().spinningImageSrc);`

If you save the file and refresh the preview pane, you should see the same spinning React logo that you did before.
Except now, instead of hard-coding the default value, you’re using `Koji.remix.get()` to retrieve the value  from the `koji.json` file.

[NOTE]
By default, `Koji.remix.get()` returns the entire `remixData` object.
In your project, this contains just one property, but it could contain more than one.
If you want to target a specific property, you can pass in an array of path strings: `Koji.remix.get([‘spinningImageSrc’])`.

== Using Koji.remix.set to set remix data

You used `Koji.remix.get` to retrieve remix data, but what if you want to allow a user to “save” a remix-specific value? We can use `Koji.remix.set` for that.
Let’s make an update to the `captureImage` function.

[source, javascript]
----
const captureImage = async () => {
   const src = await Koji.ui.capture.image();

   if (src) {
     setLogoSrc(() => src);
     await Koji.remix.set({ spinningImageSrc: src });
   }
 };
----

Using `Koji.remix.set` lets the platform know that we want to store the remix-specific data in Koji’s database, and to load it when someone views the remix.
When a user clicks the button, they are presented with the image picker.
When they choose an image, its URL is saved in the `spinningImageSrc` property.

Notice that, in addition to using `Koji.remix.set` to store the new value, you’re also updating the `logoSrc` state.
This is a good way to show a visual confirmation to the user, by presenting them with the new image that they’ve just chosen.

== Managing the remix experience

We learned in the previous section that you can use `Koji.playerState.context` to determine the initial context, which will be `default` or `remix`.
But when a user is creating a remix, they can freely move back and forth between the remix and preview modes.

When they preview the changes, it would be helpful to show them the same content that is shown in the default context, so that the user can see something similar to what they’ll see after they publish the remix.

To do that, we can use `Koji.remix.subscribe`, which allows us to “listen” to the user’s actions when toggling back and forth between the remix and preview modes.

Update `/frontend/src/App.js` to look like the following.

[source, javascript]
----
import Koji from '@withkoji/core';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [logoSrc, setLogoSrc] = useState(Koji.remix.get().spinningImageSrc);

  const { context } = Koji.playerState;

  const captureImage = async () => {
    const src = await Koji.ui.capture.image();

    if (src) {
      setLogoSrc(() => src);
      await Koji.remix.set({ spinningImageSrc: src });
    }
  };

  const [userIsRemixing, setUserIsRemixing] = useState(context === 'remix');

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = Koji.playerState.subscribe((isRemixing) => {
      setUserIsRemixing(() => isRemixing);
    });

    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    Koji.ready();
  }, []);


  if (userIsRemixing) {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <button onClick={captureImage}>Capture Image</button>
        </header>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logoSrc} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>Some New Text</p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
----

There are a few changes here, so let’s walk through them.
Notice that you’re importing `useEffect` from `react` at the top of the file.
`useEffect` is a React hook that helps to manage side effects, like fetching data or registering event listeners.
You don’t need to worry too much about the hooks syntax.
It’s more important to understand what’s being called inside each function.

In this case, you use the first `useEffect` to subscribe to an `isRemixing` listener via `Koji.playerState.subscribe`.
When the user moves into the preview mode, `isRemixing` will be `false`, and when the user moves back into the remix mode, `isRemixing` will be `true`.

You can use that listener to keep track of a local state: `userIsRemixing`.
You initialized the state with a value of `context === ‘remix’`, which we know will be true when the user first opens a remix.

The conditional render logic has also been updated, so that the remix content will be shown only if `userIsRemixing` is `true`.

You use a second `useEffect` to call `Koji.ready()`.
This lets the platform know that you’re ready to start receiving the `isRemixing` events that will trigger the `Koji.playerState.subscribe` listener.

`useEffect` blocks run sequentially, so by placing the `Koji.ready()` call in a second `useEffect` block, you ensure it will be called after you’ve subscribed to the listener.

The final piece is to add a way for the user to toggle between the remix and preview modes.
For that, you can leverage `Koji.remix.finish()`.
Let’s do that by adding an additional button to the remix content.

[source, javascript]
----
if (userIsRemixing) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <button onClick={captureImage}>Capture Image</button>
        <button onClick={finish}>Finish</button>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}
----

You also need to add the `finish` function, right after the `captureImage` definition.

[source, javascript]
----
const captureImage = async () => {
   const src = await Koji.ui.capture.image();

   if (src) {
     setLogoSrc(() => src);
     await Koji.remix.set({ spinningImageSrc: src });
   }
 };

 const finish = () => {
   Koji.remix.finish();
 };
----

== Testing in the Device Preview

Now, you can start testing the remix experience using the preview pane in the code editor.

Make sure you’re on the *Default* tab, and click the refresh button.
This will give you a new starting point (similar to finding the template via the template store and previewing it).

Click the *Remix* tab.

This mimics the user clicking on *Remix* from the template store view.
You should now see the remix content, which allows you to either a) choose a new image or b) finish and preview.

Let’s start by choosing a new image by clicking *Capture Image*.
You should be prompted with the image capture dialog.

image::RP_05_image-capture-dialog.png[The image capture dialog box]

Choose a new image, then click *Finish*.
The preview pane should change back to the *Default* view, and you should see the image you selected spinning in the center.

To mimic the user exiting out of the preview, you can click the *Remix* tab again.

At this point, you can capture a new image, or click *Finish* to move back to the *Default* view without making any changes.

== Republishing

You've set up your remix data, and you’re using `Koji.remix` to get and set dynamic values.
You’ve also used `Koji.playerState` to subscribe to changes when the user toggles between remix and preview modes.

The final thing to do is to republish your template and test it in the wild!

Navigate back to *Publish Settings* by clicking on *Publish Now*.

Clicking *Publish New Version*.

After your project has been published, use the notification link to open your template.
We haven’t put this template into the template store yet, but you can still test the remix feature.

Click the Koji button, and choose *Remix this Koji*.

image::RP_06_remix-this-koji.png[Remix this Koji]

You should be able to walk through the same steps you just tested in the preview pane, but this time, when you click *Publish*, you create a live remix from your template!

== Wrapping up

In this section, you created your first remixable template.
You’ve taken a big step towards unlocking the power of the Koji platform, and it's the first of many building blocks that will allow you to create amazing experiences with your templates.

In the final section, we take a closer look at Koji’s template store.
The template store is a place where you can market your templates.
It’s a great place to find templates from other developers, and to showcase all the amazing templates you create!
