:figure-caption!:

In the first section of the Quick Start guide, we walked through creating and publishing your first project.
In this section, we’ll dive a little deeper into the code editor, and start exploring making changes and updates to a project.

By the end of this section, you should feel comfortable:

* Using the code editor to make and save changes to a project.
* Using the code editor’s preview to see real-time changes to a project.
* Publishing updates to a project.

== Editing a project

In software, it’s important to be able to separate a development environment from a production environment. As we learned in the last section, Koji makes this easy by allowing you to maintain a “draft” of your project in the code editor, and publishing your project when you’re happy with the changes that you’ve made.

Let’s start by going back to the code editor for your project.
If you’ve closed out of the code editor since the last section, you go to the https://withkoji.com/developer/projects[Developer Portal] to open a list of your projects.
Select the project that you published in the last section, and then choose *Open in Code Editor* to re-open the project.

== File and Folder Navigation

On the left hand side of the code editor, you will see some navigation items at the top, and below that, the *Source Code* section provides a file and folder style navigation that will allow you to explore and open files in your project.

Let’s start by opening the `frontend/src` folder.

Click the `frontend` folder to show its contents.
Then click the `src` subfolder to show its contents.

== Opening a File

You can open a file by clicking on it inside the *Source Code* section.

Click `App.js`.

You should see the file contents in the editing pane.
If you have any other files open, you can close them by clicking the “X” icon in the file tab.

== Editing and Saving a File

Let’s start by making a quick edit.
In the `App` function, let’s replace the text inside the `<p>` tag with "Some New Text".

[source, javascript]
----
function App() {
 return (
   <div className="App">
     <header className="App-header">
       <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
       <p>Some New Text</p>
     </header>
   </div>
 );
}
----

Note that when you make a change to a file, a *Save (Ctrl+S)* button appears.
Click the button to save your changes.
You can also save by pressing `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`, depending on your operating system.

When the file is saved, the notification disappears. 

== Previewing Changes

When you saved your file, you might have noticed that the preview on the right hand side of the screen updated automatically.

This happens for two reasons.
First, we bootstrapped this project with Create React App, which gives us a hot-reloading development environment where changes are compiled in real time and modules automatically reload when needed.

Second, Koji maps the development server to a live staging URL and loads the URL into an iframe inside the code editor.
This is a handy tool for developers because it also allows you to open the URL in a separate tab.
You can even share the staging link with others so that they can see your work-in-progress.

If you’d like to view your project in a separate tab, you can open it by clicking the *Open in New Tab* button.

== Republishing

You’ve only made a minor change, but let’s pretend that you just fixed a bug.
You want to make sure the bug fix is applied to your project.
You do that by republishing your project.
That will ensure that when a user comes back to visit your project’s permalink, they will see the most recently published version.

Navigate back to *Publish Settings* by clicking *Publish Now*.
The changes you’ve made to the project since your last publish are shown.

If you don't see any changes listed, this could mean that you forgot to save.

To republish, scroll down to the bottom of *Publish Settings*, and click on *Publish New Version*.

After your project has been republished, you will see a success notification with a link to the published project (the same permalink as before).
You can visit that link to confirm that the live version of the project has been updated.

== Wrapping up

You should now be familiar with exploring the folders and files in your project, making changes, and publishing updates.

In the next section, we look at some more Koji’s tools you can use to make your project much more interesting.
