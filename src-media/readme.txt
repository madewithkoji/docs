README - src-media

This folder contains files used to create images and other media.

* For image files, these could be Snagit files (.snag) or Gimp files (.xcf).
* For audio files, TBD.
* For video files, TBD.

These are preserved to be able to reuse unflattened or uncombined components to quickly generate variations of the final media file.

Examples:
* For images, the components could be the underlying image, the callouts, the overlays (such as blur blocks).
* For videos, the components could be the underlying video, the audio combined with it, the bottom-third overlay.
* For audio, the components could be the individual tracks containing background sounds, music, or voice.
