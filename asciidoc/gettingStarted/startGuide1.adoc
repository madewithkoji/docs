= Developing your first Koji template

== Summary

On the Koji platform, you can develop JavaScript web applications that can be customized without coding. Instead, non-technical users can use Visual Customization Controls (VCCs) to quickly edit elements of the application, such as images, text, and sounds.

In this starter guide, you will start with an existing web
application on Koji, called a “template,” and add the ability to customize, or “remix,” it. You will use the Koji editor and an npm package from Koji to define the customizable elements. Then, you will publish your application as a new template so that Koji users can create their own customized versions of it.

== Remixing the starter template

. If you haven’t already, create an account at https://withkoji.com[withkoji.com].
. Go to https://withkoji.com/templates/seane/react-project-no-vccs[https://withkoji.com/templates/seane/react-project-no-vccs].
. Click *Create Remix*.
+
This action creates a clone of the starter template, and opens it in the Koji editor.
. Explore the template and the Koji editor.
* In the right pane, you can see a live preview of the template.
* In the left pane, you can click *Source Code* to expand the file browser. From here, you can open and edit your project files in the editor.
* At the bottom, you can expand a set of terminal tabs. These tabs enable you to run the template locally from inside the editor and to execute other terminal functions, such as adding packages and committing changes.
+
NOTE: If you make changes to your project’s structure (by adding npm packages, for example), you might need to exit the running process and restart the development server in the `frontend` terminal.

== Installing the @withkoji/vcc package

The @withkoji/vcc package allows your template to access dynamic values that are stored in customization files. It also allows you to expose VCCs so that a user can change the customizable items in your template. Finally, it provides a watcher function that allows you to monitor changes to customization files and perform a real-time set of the dynamic values stored in the customization files.

. In the terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder of your template.
. Cancel the running process (for example, press *Ctrl+C*).
. Install the latest version of the package:
[source, bash]
npm install --save @withkoji/vcc
. In the `frontend` folder of your project, reconfigure the
`package.json` file to run the watcher concurrently with your
development server. You can use a package like npm-run-all. For example:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
"build": "NODE_ENV=production webpack --config ./.internals/webpack.production.js --color -p --progress --hide-modules --display-optimization-bailout",
"start": "npm-run-all -p watch start:server",
"watch": "koji-vcc watch",
"start:server": "node index.js" <1>
----
<1> Replace with the "start" command for your project
+
[NOTE]
====
If you follow the example pattern, you must also install the npm-run-all package:
[source,bash]
npm install --save-dev npm-run-all
====

. Restart the process to reflect the new changes:
[source, bash]
npm start

## Creating a customization file

A customization file is a JSON file that defines the names and types of the customizable values in a template, so that Koji can display the appropriate VCCs for remixers.

. In the `.koji/customization` folder of your project, create a new JSON file.
.. In the file browser, click the plus (*+*) next to the `.koji/customization` folder, and click *New File*.
.. Enter a name for the file. For example: `settings.json`.
. Paste the following code into your `settings.json` file.
+
This code defines a scope and the customizable values within that scope.
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "settings": {
  "title": "Hello World!"
},
"@@editor": [
  {
    "key": "settings",
    "name": "App settings",
    "icon": "⚙️",
    "source": "settings.json",
    "fields": [
        {
          "key": "title",
          "name": "App title",
          "type": "text"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
----
. Press *Ctrl-S* to save the file.
+
A new item appears in the *Customization* section of the left pane.
. Click the item in the *Customization* section to display the associated VCC in the editor.
+
In this example, the file stores one customizable value (`settings.title`), and Koji displays a text VCC to collect this value from a remixer.

== Accessing the values stored in a customization file

To access a value from a JSON customization file within a template, you use a getter from the @withkoji/vcc package. Then, update the template to use dynamic values, instead of hard-coded values.

. From the left pane of the editor, open the `frontend/common/App.js` file.
+
This file contains most of the template logic.
. At the top of the file, import the package.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
import { InstantRemixing } from '@withkoji/vcc';
----
. In the React component, add the `componentDidMount` method.
+
This method creates a new instance of the `InstantRemixing` class to use in the template.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
componentDidMount() {
this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();
console.log('instantRemixing', this.instantRemixing); // Confirm w/log

// Alert Koji we are ready to use instantRemixing
this.instantRemixing.ready();
}
----
. Create a state to handle updates to the title (`h1`) value, and update the contents of the `h1` element to use the dynamic value.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    title: '',
};

...

render() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <h1>{this.state.title}</h1>
      <Image src={'https://images.koji-cdn.com/d9c6b38e-08c4-4faf-ae8e-01082c41a0fb/3f83q-9634d620e97345a6b250ca2feb7e5a2e.png'} />
    </Container>
);
}
}
----

. In the `componentDidMount` method, use the getter function from `instantRemixing` to get the default value from the customization file.
+
The getter accepts an array (`[scope, key]`) that maps to the scope (`settings`) and key (`title`) from the JSON customization file.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
componentDidMount() {
  this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

  // Set the default value
  this.setState({
    title: this.instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'title'])
  });

  // Alert Koji we are ready to use instantRemixing
  this.instantRemixing.ready();
}
----

== Reacting to updated values

When a remixer enters a new value, the template must update automatically to reflect the change.

* In the `componentDidMount` method, set up a listener to monitor for changes to the template value:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----

componentDidMount() {
  this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

// Alert Koji we are ready to use instantRemixing
this.instantRemixing.ready();

// Set the default value
this.setState({
  title: this.instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'title'])
});

// Set up a listener to update title value
this.instantRemixing.onValueChanged((path, newValue) => {
  if (path[0] && path[1] && path[0] === 'settings' && path[1] === 'title') {
    this.setState({ title: newValue });
  }
});
}
----

## Testing the current state of the template

At this point, the template should be configured to use the default value from the customization file and to react to value changes that are made from VCCs. To test this configuration, you can use the built-in VCC and live preview in the Koji editor.

1. In the top right of the *Live Preview* pane, click *Refresh* to make sure you are seeing the latest version.
2. From the left pane of the editor, click *Customization > App Settings* to open the VCC for the `settings.json` customization file.
3. In the VCC, update the value in the *App title* field.
+
The preview window should reflect your update automatically.

## Determining the current view of the template

The template must display differently and expose different click handlers depending on whether a user is viewing or customizing the template. In this example, you will add styles to show that the `h1` element is editable and a click handler to expose a VCC when a user is customizing the template.

. Create a property (`isRemixing`) to track the current view state, and set the initial state with a placeholder value.
+
[source, JavaScript]
----
state = {
  isRemixing: false,
  title: '',
};
----

. In the `componentDidMount` method, add the default value (`this.instantRemixing.isRemixing`) to the `setState` function, and add a listener that monitors the template for view changes.
+
This listener allows you to use `this.state.isRemixing` as a source of truth for the current view of the template.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
componentDidMount() {
this.instantRemixing = new InstantRemixing();

// Set the default value for title and isRemixing state
this.setState({
  isRemixing: this.instantRemixing.isRemixing,
  title: this.instantRemixing.get(['settings', 'title'])
});

  // Set up a listener to update title value
this.instantRemixing.onValueChanged((path, newValue) => {
  if (path[0] && path[1] && path[0] === 'settings' && path[1] === 'title') {
    this.setState({ title: newValue });
  }
});

// Toggle the isRemixing state based on the listener
this.instantRemixing.onSetRemixing((isRemixing) => {
  this.setState({ isRemixing });
});

// Alert Koji we are ready to use instantRemixing
this.instantRemixing.ready();
}
----

== Exposing the VCC

The template must expose a way for a remixer to open the VCC when customizing it.

* Add a click handler to the `h1` element that opens the VCC when the remixer clicks the title.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
handleClick = () => {
  // Conditionally handle the click, only if the template is being remixed
if (this.state.isRemixing) {
this.instantRemixing.onPresentControl(['settings', 'title']);
}
};

render() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.title}</h1>
      <Image src={'https://images.koji-cdn.com/d9c6b38e-08c4-4faf-ae8e-01082c41a0fb/3f83q-9634d620e97345a6b250ca2feb7e5a2e.png'} />
    </Container>
  );
}
----

## Testing the expose function

To test whether the expose function is working, you can use the *Editing* tab of the *Live Preview* pane. This feature enables you to test the template as if it were published on Koji.

1. In the *Live Preview* pane, click *Editing* to switch to the template editing mode.
2. Click the title in the preview.
+
The VCC should open automatically and allow for text input. If this test works correctly, the VCC should be exposed correctly to the remixer in your published template.

## Styling the customizable item

To indicate that an item is “editable,” you can add a conditional visual effect that is displayed when the template is being customized. In this example, you’ll add a CSS style class for editable items and then apply the class to the `h1` when a user is customizing the template.

. From the left pane of the editor, open the `frontend/common/index.html` file.
. Add the following CSS style in the `head` element.
+
[source,HTML]
----
<style>
  .active {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
    padding: 18px;
    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    border-image: initial;
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
</style>
----
+
. In the `App.js` file, update the `h1` element with a dynamic `className`.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
<h1
  className={this.state.isRemixing ? 'active' : ''}
  onClick={this.handleClick}
  >
  {this.state.title}
</h1>
----

. To test the dynamic `className`, you can toggle the live preview between the *Editing* and *Preview* modes.
* In *Editing* mode, the “editable” styles should be visible, and the click handler should open the VCC, as expected.
* In *Preview* mode, the “editable” styles should not be visible, and nothing should happen when clicking the `h1` element.

== Making the template “feed-aware”

Koji uses a feed to enable users to browse available templates. As with traditional social feeds, items move from off screen or out of focus, into the main window inside the feed. To ensure the template is displayed correctly in the Koji feed, you use the FeedSdk from the @withkoji/vcc package to set the template state and handle transitions between on and off screen and in and out of focus.

. Import the `FeedSdk` from the @withkoji/vcc package.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
import { FeedSdk, InstantRemixing } from '@withkoji/vcc';
----
. At the end of the `componentDidMount` method, add the following code to display the template in the feed.
+
This code creates an instance of the feed and calls a load function to indicate that the template is ready to be displayed in the feed, which is all that is required when the template does not use autoplay.
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
this.feed = new FeedSdk();
this.feed.load();
----
NOTE: If you plan to develop apps that autoplay when focused in the feed, you can use the `onPlaybackStateChanged` listener to monitor for real-time updates as the template enters and leaves focus in the feed, similar to how this example uses `onSetRemixing`.

## Adding entitlements for the Koji profiler

When you publish the template, it is submitted into a queue for profiling. The Koji profiler checks for errors and generates metadata about the application. If the template is error-free, the profiler enables additional platform features for your template, including the instant remix option and inclusion in the feed. To prepare your template to be profiled correctly, you must add entitlements for some of these features.

*   In the `.koji/project` folder, create an `entitlements.json` file with the following code:
+
[source, JSON]
----
include::../codeSamples/entitlements.json[]
----
This code indicates that the template supports remixes and is ready to be listed in the feed.

== Publishing the template

At this point, the template is ready to be published.

. To view the template on the staging server before you publish it, click the *Remote* tab in the right pane, and then use one of the options to open a preview in another tab or on another device.
. In the upper left of the editor, click *Publish Now* to open the publish settings.
. Give your template a unique name and add a description.
+
NOTE: The permalink URL to your template is based on the name when you first publish it, so be sure to enter the name you want to use going forward. You can republish it to update any template functionality and settings, but the link remains the same.

. Click *Publish*.
+
A message appears to indicate that the publishing process has started.
When publishing is completed, a link appears in the message.
. Click the link to view and test your live template.
+
The template might be published before profiling is completed.
Therefore, you might need to wait longer before testing features that require profiling, such as inclusion in the feed or the ability to instantly remix the template. To see the results of the most recent profiling, from your live template, click *Make your own > Fork template* to open the template welcome screen. Then, under *More options*, click *See profiled attributes*.
+
If an error message appears when you open the link after profiling is completed, you can review the steps in this guide to fix it. To open your project again, go to *Koji home > My projects*, and click the template name.
